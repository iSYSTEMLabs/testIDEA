    <h1>Run the test</h1>

    We can run test cases either with one of run options in the main
    menu <code>Test</code> or equivalent toolbar icon (see tooltip
    texts of toolbar icons to find out their meaning).  <p/>
    
    When the tests completes, <i>iSYSTEM testIDEA</i> marks each
    test and section with a marker. If everything was OK, a green
    check mark is shown, otherwise we get a red mark with cross
    inside. The image below shows a test, which has passed successfully:
    <br>

    <p align="center">
    <img width="90%" src="images/successfulTest.png"/>
    </p>

    <br>
    The Status view shows test result summary. Because all tests
    completed without an error, the detailed view on the right side of
    the status view above has green background color.<p>
    Below we can see test results with error:<p>
    <p/>
    <br>

    <p align="center">
    <img width="90%" src="images/failedTest.png"/>
    </p>

    <br>
    Result markers on each test are convenient when implementing
    tests, but we can not print them or save them. This can be done
    with reports, which are described in the <a href="viewReport.html">next section</a>
    .
