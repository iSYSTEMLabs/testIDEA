    <i>(Professional version only)</i><p>
    
    <i>iSYSTEM testIDEA</i> can save test results in XML, YAML, CSV,
    XLS, or XLSX file formats.<p>
    
    <b>XML</b> format is convenient for usage in other tools, including
    viewing in web browsers, because it is widely supported.<p>
    
    <b>YAML</b> format is not so well known, but it
    is much more readable and as such convenient for quick overview in
    text editor.<p>
    
    <b>CSV</b> (Comma Separated Values) format is also understood by many
    other tools, for example it can be imported to rquirements
    management tools, such as DOORS.<p>

    <b>XLS</b> and <b>XLSX</b> are Excel (old and new) formats.

    <p/>
    If we want to view test results in web browser as HTML and print
    them, <i>iSYSTEM testIDEA</i> provides XML Style sheet
    templates. We can use one of the default templates, or create our
    own. If we would like to change colors only, they are stored in
    CSS file. More about template files can be found in section 
    <a href="../tasks/xsltAndCss.html">XSLT and CSS</a>
    <p/>
    To save test results, select option <i>Test | Save Test Report</i>
    from the main menu. The <i>Save Test Report</i> dialog
    opens. Enter output file name and select one of built-in
    XSLTs. The dialog is shown below:
    <p/>

    <p align="center">
    <img width="90%" src="images/saveTestReportDialog.png"/>
    </p>

    <p/> When we click OK, the report is saved and the default browser
    for XML files opens. Usually this is a web browser, which knows
    how to transform XML to HTML with appropriate XSLT. Internet
    Explorer and Firefox were tested with default XSLTs, while 
    some versions of Chrome have a bug, which prevents opening
    of local XSLT files.

    <p/> Example report is shown below: <p/>

    We've finished the first test now. Next sections describe
    <i>iSYSTEM testIDEA</i> functionality and usage in more detail.
