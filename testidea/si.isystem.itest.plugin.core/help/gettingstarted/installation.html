    <h1>Installation</h1>

    This section describes how to install <i>iSYSTEM testIDEA</i>. It
    applies only for those who want to install <i>testIDEA</i> separately from
    <i>winIDEA</i>. If you have installed full <i>winIDEA</i> setup, <i>testIDEA</i> is
    already installed on your system, and you <b>should skip this step</b>.

    <h2>Prerequisites</h2>

    The following software needs to be installed on the system to be
    able to run and use <i>iSYSTEM testIDEA</i>:
    <ul>
        <li><a href ="http://www.java.com/en/download/index.jsp">Java Runtime Environment (JRE) version 1.7</a> is a must to run
        <i>iSYSTEM testIDEA</i></li>

        <li><i>winIDEA</i> version 9.12 or later. This is not required to run
        <i>iSYSTEM testIDEA</i>, but only to run tests. You can
        write, edit, and save test specifications without
        <i>winIDEA</i>. However, content assistance (list of functions, 
        variables, ... on input fields) is not available
        without <i>winIDEA</i>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Download and install</h2>

    <i>testIDEA</i> installation is part of <i>winIDEA</i>
    installation. If you need to update or install it separately from
    <i>winIDEA</i>, contact iSYSTEM support for the installation file. Then unzip
    the file to your hard disk. There is a <i>iSystem_testIDEA.exe</i>
    executable in the unzipped folder. Make desktop shortcut for your
    convenience.
