    <h1>iSYSTEM testIDEA Overview</h1>

    
<i>iSYSTEM testIDEA</i> is an application for embedded software tests. It
expands iSYSTEM's debug and trace tools for software development with
testing functionality.

<h3>Main features:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<i>testIDEA</i> is interactive editor for <i>creating </i>and <i>running</i> tests.
</li>
<li>
All <i>scopes</i> of tests are supported - from testing single line of
code, to function and system tests.
</li>
<li>
It creates <i>reports</i> with detailed information about test execution and
results.
</li>
<li>
<i>Integration with winIDEA</i> is provided.
</li>
<li>
Test cases and test vectors are executed on the real
customer hardware <i>without code instrumentation</i> - other tools usually
instrument the code.
</li>
<li>
The major advantage of non-instrumented unit tests is the <i>fast
turn-around-times</i>, because the tests can run without compilation,
linking and download.
</li>
<li>
<i>No test drivers</i> are needed and therefore no additional resources are
used on the target system.
</li>
<li>
Functions like <i>tracing, profiling and code coverage analysis</i> can be
integrated into the test cases.
</li>
<li>
Test cases can be created <i>without knowing</i> the <code>isystem.test</code> API.
</li>
<li>
testIDEA stores the test cases in YAML format. <a href="http://www.yaml.org/">YAML</a>
is human friendly data serialization standard. <i>Human friendliness</i> is
its main advantage over XML.
</li>
<li>
Test specification files can be easily edited with any <i>text editor</i> and
later used either by scripts or testIDEA.
</li>
<li>
Tests created with testIDEA can be easily <i>used in scripts</i>
via <code>isystem.test</code> API.
</li>
<li>
Integration with <code>isystem.connect</code> API expands the operation area
of iSYSTEM test technology from unit testing to integration and system
testing.
</li>
</ul>
