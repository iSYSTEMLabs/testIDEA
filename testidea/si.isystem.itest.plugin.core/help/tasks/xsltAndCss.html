    <h1>XML Stylesheet Templates</h1>

    XML files in their natural format are not very readable, because
    tags and delimiters hide the real data. There are also no colors
    to emphasize important data, font is the same for complete file,
    ...<br/>

    Since conversion of XML to something more human readable is a
    common task, a special standard is defined by W3C, called <a
    href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt">XSL Transformations</a>. These
    transformations are described in XML files, and define how to
    convert XML file to something else, for example XHTML.
    <p/>

    XSLTs are used by <i>iSYSTEM testIDEA</i> to display test
    reports, which are stored in XML format, in web browser. You can
    use built-in XSLTs, or write your own.
    <p/>

    When built-in template is used, it is automatically copied to the
    same folder as XML test report. 
    
    <h3>CSS</h3>

    Sometimes we want to show test report in the same form, but with
    other colors. For example, printing on black-and-white printer may
    require different colors than viewing on a color monitor. To avoid
    creation of new XSLT file for each color set, the built-in XSLTs
    use external <a href
    ="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets">CSS
    (Cascading Style Sheets)</a> files. This is also configurable in dialog
    for saving test reports.

    <h3>Custom XSLT and CSS files</h3>

    When we want to customize the test reports, we can take the
    built-in XSLT and CSS file and modify them according to our
    needs. 
    
    <h3>Embedding XSLT and CSS files</h3>
    To get complete test report in one XML file, instead of in three files (XML 
    for data, XSLT for transformation, CSS for colors and other HTML style properties),
    it is possible to configure <i>testIDEA</i> to embed XSLT and CSS files into 
    XML report file (<code>Test | Configure Test Report ...</code>). This creates larger file, and makes sense if there are not many 
    report files. Otherwise, if XSLT and CSS are reused by several XML report
    files, it is better to keep them as standalone files.
    <p/>
    <h4>Browser compatibility</h4>
    Not all browsers may show standalone and embedded versions of report properly.
    While Internet Explorer has problems with single file (XSLT and CSS embedded),
    Chrome does not show report when XSLT is stored to separate file. Firefox
    properly shows report in both cases.
