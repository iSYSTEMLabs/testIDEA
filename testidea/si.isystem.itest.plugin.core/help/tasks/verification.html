    <h1>Verification of test specifications</h1>

    It can happen, that we mistype function or variable name in test
    specification, or that it is renamed in source code. Wrong number
    of function parameters can also result in invalid test result or
    even target crash. To discover such problems before running tests,
    a new command <i>iTools | Verify symbols</i> has been added to
    <i>testIDEA</i>. Problems are shown in the status view. By double
    clicking the problem line in the status view, we can select test
    specification related to the problem.

    Most problems are displayed in the status view already during
    editing of test specifications.
