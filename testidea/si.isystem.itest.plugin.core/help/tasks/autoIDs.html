    <h1>Automatic test ID assignment</h1>

    Unique test IDs are important in several use cases, for example
    when exporting/importing test specifications, or as references
    to tests used by other tools. Since manual creation of unique IDs
    is time consuming and error prone, <i>testIDEA</i> provides
    configurable test ID generator. The test ID generator is configured by
    format string in project properties dialog
    (command <code>File | Properties)</code>, with <code>Auto ID
    Format</code> string:
    

    <p align="center">
    <img width="90%" src="images/projPropsAutoId.png"/>
    </p>

    The format string consists of fixed text and variables, which have
    the following syntax: <code>${&lt;varName&gt;}</code>.<br>

    The string is broken to parts in the wizard, where all variables
    are also described:
    
    <p align="center">
    <img width="90%" src="images/autoIdWizard.png"/>
    </p>

    The main property of IDs is their uniqueness, but we can also
    include some other information about the test case, for example
    function parameters. For this reason the test ID generator
    can create IDs composed of a <i>unique string</i> and some <i>test case parameters</i>.
    For unique part of an ID we use one of variables <code>${uid},
    ${nid}, ${uuid}, </code> or <code> ${seq}.</code> It is highly
    recommended to use the character '/' as a separator for unique part
    of test ID. If later want to update only informational
    part, because parameters changed, <i>testIDEA</i> can split the
    test ID and change only the requested part. Example:
    <pre>
      /${uid}/${params}
    </pre>
    
    Since only a limited set of characters is allowed for test IDs,
    all invalid characters in function names, parameters and tags are
    replaced by underscore character. '-' is used as a separator between
    parameters and tags.<p><p>


    <h2>Assigning IDs</h2>
    Once we've defined the format string, we can run automatic
    ID assignment with command <code>iTools | Set Test IDs</code>:

    <p align="center">
    <img width="90%" src="images/autoIdCommandDialog.png"/>
    </p>

    For new tests we can assign ID on creation if we check
    the <code>Auto generate ID</code> check box in the <code>New test</code> dialog
    (command <code>File | New Test</code>).
