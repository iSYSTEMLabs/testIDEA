    <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
    
    As the name implies, continuous integration (CI) requires running of tests 
    repeatedly during the development cycle. This way we find problems soon 
    after they appear, which usually makes fixing easier. Since repetitive 
    tasks are better left to machines, server applications specialized for
    running build/test cycles were implemented. One of the most popular 
    CI servers is <a href = 'https://jenkins.io/'>Jenkins</a>. To simplify CI process,
    iSYSTEM tools provide support for running tests and displaying tests results 
    with Jenkins:
    
    <ul>
    <li>testIDEA can create Python scripts, which can be run directly by 
        Jenkins.</li>
    
    <li>The scripts can produce result in JUnit XML format, which is understood 
        by Jenkins.</li>
    
    <li>Coverage information can be exported in format understood by 
        Jenkins.</li>
    
    <li>Test cases can produce coverage document in HTML format, which can be
        linked directly from Jenkins. This document contains all coverage information
        recoreded by iSYSTEM tools, which can be more detailed than existing
        Jenkins plug-ins can show.</li>  
    </ul>

      </p>

    
    <h2 id="script">Create Python script for test execution</h2>

	To generate Python script for running tests headless from command line
	or Jenkins, use menu command <span class="menuCmd">iTools |
    Generate Test Script ...</span>). The dialog opens, which contains the
    following configuration items related to Jenkins:

	<ul>
		<li id='dllPath'>Path to <i>isystem.connect</i> DLL should be set if Jenkins will
			run tests as a service. In this case 
			<code>ConnectionMgr::connectMRU()</code> call in Python script can
			not find and start the last winIDEA started with normal user account. 
			<span id='dllEnvVar'/>The other solution to this problem includes 
			setting of an environment 
			variable to point to winIDEA installation directory, for example:
            <pre>
              SET ICONNECT_PATH="C:\winIDEA\2012\iConnect.dll"
            </pre>
      
		</li>
		<li>Saving of report in JUnit format. This format is recognized
			by Jenkins server, which can then include <i>testIDEA</i> test
			results in its reports.
		</li>
		<li id='coberturaExport'>Exporting of one analyzer file in Cobertura 
		    format (download files are mapped to packages in this export). 
		    Cobertura is coverage tool for Java, and there exists plug-in for 
		    Jenkins, which displays results in graphical form.<br/>
		     
			The analyzer file is winIDEA file containing coverage, and it
			can be created either by test case, test group or extension script.
			It is recommended to use analyzer file which contains coverage of all
			code under test.
		</li>
	</ul>

    <h2 id="install">Install Jenkins</h2>
    
      <a href='https://jenkins.io/'>Jenkins home page</a> provides download link
      and instructions for installation. If you're planning to show coverage 
      results in Jenkins, install also Cobertura plug-in.
      
      
    <h2 id="runAsService">Run headless tests as a service</h2>
    
        This section describes configuration of Jenkins to run iSYSTEM tests. 
        Note, that test script can be generated with testIDEA, but it is also
        possible to write the script manually.<p/>

	    <b>Important:</b> Make sure you have specified path to <i>iConnect.dll</i> 
        when <a href='#dllPath'>generating script in testIDEA</a>, 
        or <a href='#dllEnvVar'>set environment variable</a>.

        <ol>      
	    <li><b>Create new project</b>
        Enter project name and select <i>Freestyle project</i>, as shown in the image below.
	    
	    <p align="center">
	      <img width="90%" src="images/jenkinsNewProject.png"/>
	    </p>
	    </li>
	    <li><b>Configure the project</b>
	
	    <p align="center">
	      <img width="90%" src="images/jenkinsConfigure-1.png"/>
	    </p>
	
	    <p align="center">
	      <img width="90%" src="images/jenkinsConfigure-2.png"/>
	    </p>
	
	    Name of <i>Test report XMLs</i> (JUnit file) must be the same as
	    name of test report configured in testIDEA, but with
	    extension <i>.junit.xml</i>.<p>
	    </li>
	    <li><b>Run the project</b>
	    
	    Click <i>Build Now</i> in the menu, and wait for execution to
	    finish. To observe progress, open console by double clicking the
	    flashing icon next to build in the <i>Build History</i> box.
	
	    <p align="center">
	      <img width="90%" src="images/jenkinsTestRun.png"/>
	    </p>
	
	    Click the build number to get menu with build details, including
	    console output and test result.
	    </li>
      </ol>
      
    <h2 id="runAsUser">Run tests with normal user account</h2>

      For debugging purposes it may be useful to run tests with account
      of logged user, not with Jenkins's account. In this case winIDEA
      window is visible. The test script uses preferences of the
      currently logged user for starting winIDEA, and winIDEA is
      not started as a service. <p>
      
      <ol>
      <li><b>Enable Java Web Start</b>
        Open <i>Top level menu | Manage Jenkins | Configure Global
        Security</i>. Then select <i>Enable security</i>
        and <i>Random</i>.
      
        <p align="center">
          <img width="90%" src="images/jenkinsJWSEnable.png"/>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li><b>Create executor, which uses Java Web Start</b>

        Open <i>Top level menu | Manage Jenkins | Manage Nodes | New Node</i>

	    <p align="center">
	      <img width="90%" src="images/jenkinsNewNode.png"/>
	    </p>

	    Click OK to get he next configuration screen.
	    
	    <p align="center">
	      <img width="90%" src="images/jenkinsNodeConfiguration.png"/>
	    </p>
	</li>
    <li><b>Select agent in project configuration</b>
	    <p align="center">
	      <img width="90%" src="images/jenkinsNodeSelection.png"/>
	    </p>
	</li>
    <li><b>Start executor agent</b>

	    In main dashboard, click node jwsGui in Build Executor Status box,
	    to get the screen shown below:
	
	    <p align="center">
	      <img width="90%" src="images/jenkinsStartAgent.png"/>
	    </p>
	
	    Connect the agent, then run the project.
	  </li>
    </ol>
      
      
    <h2 id="coverage">iSYSTEM coverage in Jenkins</h2>
    
    To view iSYSTEM coverage measurements in Jenkins, you can add link to 
    HTML report created by iSYSTEM tools, or use Cobertura plug-in in Jenkins.
    The first approach provides more information, while the second approach 
    provides quick overview of trends in graphical way. It possible to
    use both approaches in the same project.<br>
    If analyzer file from test case is used, it is very important to set
    value of <i>Measure all functions</i> in section 
    <i>Analyzer | Coverage | Statistics</i>. If this check-box is checked, 
    all code in the project is considered as 100% coverage. If it is not checked,
    only functions explicitly mentioned in the statistics section are considered
    as coverage goal (100% coverage).    
    
    <ul><li>To add link to iSYSTEM HTML report, open project configuration, and
    add post-build action <i>Publish HTML reports</i>.
     
        <p align="center">
          <img width="90%" src="images/publishHtmlCvrg.png"/>
        </p>
        
        The information shown in this report depends on coverage export 
        configuration. See section <i>Analyzer | Coverage</i>, group <i>Export 
        configuration</i> in testIDEA.<p> 
    </li>
    <li>To see coverage trends, create test script so that 
      it <a href='#coberturaExport'>exports analyzer (trd) file in
				Cobertura format</a>. Then add post-build action 
				<i>Publish Cobertura Coverage Report</i> to project 
       configuration in Jenkins.
        
        <p align="center">
          <img width="90%" src="images/publishCobertura.png"/>
        </p>
    </li>
    </ul>
