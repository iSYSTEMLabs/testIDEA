    <h1>Exporting and Importing test cases</h1>

    <i>(Professional version only)</i><p>

    To enhance testIDEA with functionality offered by other
    applications, we have several possibilities for exporting and
    importing test cases. The usual procedure involves
    creation of the base test case in testIDEA, exporting it,
    creating variants in external tool, and then importing of the
    generated tests. Then we run tests with testIDEA.<p>

    Available export formats can be seen in the export dialog:

            <p align="center">
            <img width="90%" src="images/exportImportDialog.png"/>
            </p>

    They are described in the following sections:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#csv">Spreadsheets and CSV</a></li>
      <li><a href="#cte">Testona</a></li>
    </ul>
    

    <a name="csv"/>
    <h2>Spreadsheets and CSV</h2>
    
    When we want to create a set of test cases for the same
    function, but with different values of parameters, editing is
    easier with tools like Excel or Open Office Calc. For this purpose
    we can use <i>testIDEA's</i> export and import functionality. The
    general procedure is the following:<p>

    <ol>
      <li>Create base test case in testIDEA. It should
      specify the function to be tested and any other items, which
      define the test. For example, the most common such items are
      function parameters and expected return values. <i>testIDEA</i>
      exports the following items, if defined:
        <ul>
          <li>Function parameters</li>
          
           <li>Expected values. The expected expression is split to
           two parts where the split point is the last operator. The
           first part is written in the second row, while the second
           part is added to the first one on import. For example, the
           expression <code>'rv == 3'</code> is split to <code>'rv
           =='</code> and <code>'3'</code>. If we enter values <code>'4'</code>,
           <code>'5'</code>, and <code>'6'</code> in the column
           below <code>'rv =='</code> in the exported spread sheet,
           derived tests will have expected expressions <code>'rv ==
           4'</code>, <code>'rv == '5'</code>, and <code>'rv ==
           6'</code>.
           </li>
           
           <li>Initialized variables</li>
           <li>Assignments for stubs</li>
           <li>Statistics requirements for coverage</li>
           <li>Profiler timing and hits requirements</li>
           <li>HIL parameters</li>
           <li>winIDEA options</li>
           </ul>
        
        Please note again, that the above items are exported only if
        they are defined in the base test case. For example,
        if the base test case does not specify HIL
        parameters, HIL section will not be exported.<p>

        Comments are also exported to Excel, but it is <b>not</b> recommended to
        edit them in Excel, because certain format must be
        used. Otherwise comments can't be imported back to testIDEA.<p>        
        
        Sections, which are not exported, for example declarations of
        variables, <b>are lost on import</b>. The same is true for comments
        in these sections.<p>
        

        The base test case must have test ID defined,
        otherwise <i>testIDEA</i> reports an error. <p>
      </li>
      
      <li>Select the test case(s) in testIDEA, then execute
      command <code>File | Export</code>. All selected test
      cases get exported to the selected file. In XLS file
      each test case gets its own sheet, while in CSV file
      they are separated by lines with test IDs. An example of
        exported test case is shown below:
        
            <p align="center">
            <img width="90%" src="images/exportedTestSpec.png"/>
            </p>
      </li>

      <li>Edit the exported file in some third party tool, like Excel,
      Calc, ...). The following rules must be taken into account while
      editing:
        <ul>
          <li> Do not edit the first row of each test
          case. It defines test sections, and the naming and
          order are important here. 
            </li>
          <li>
            Edit the second row with identifier names only when
            renaming them, or modifying expected expression. It is
            preferred to rename items in <i>testIDEA</i>, and then
            export the test case again.
            </li>
          <li>
            The third row contains values of the base test
            case. It is there for information only - it
            is not parsed on import, so any changes done
            here are ignored.
            </li>
            <li>
              The fourth and next rows should contain values to be
              used for derived test cases. If we enter
              formulas, the calculated values will be used.
            </li>
          </ul>
          Empty rows in CSV files are ignored, rows which start with '#'
          character are treated as comments and are also ignored.
        </li>
      <p>
      An example of edited test case is shown below:
            <p align="center">
            <img width="90%" src="images/editedTestSpec.png"/>
            </p>

      <li>
        Save the file and import it in <i>testIDEA</i>. If we want to
        import derived test cases only for some base test
        cases, we can select those base test cases
        and then check the 'Import data only to selected test
        cases' check box in the import dialog.
        <b>All existing derived test cases of the selected test
        cases are deleted on import!</b>
      </li>
    </ol>

   After import we can execute the tests. If we want to modify the
   values of derived tests parameters, we don not have to export the
   test case again, but simply change values in the exported
   file and import them again.

  <h2>Testona</h2>

  Testona (former CTE XL Professional) provides graphical view of
  test cases with variations of test inputs, and enables rule based
  creation of tests cases, while <i>testIDEA</i> provides
  execution of test cases with analyzer measurements and HIL.<br>
  
  To use the benefits of both applications, we can use testIDEA's
  export/import functionality and share the data in both ways.<p>

  Usual workflow includes the following steps:
  <ul>
  <li> Create base test case in testIDEA. Define all sections,
    which are needed for testing.</li>
  <li> (optional) Create few derived test cases, which contain
    typical values of test inputs (Testona classes)</li>
  <li> Select the base test case in testIDEA and export it to
    Testona format with command <code>File | Export</code>.</li>
  <li> Open the file in Testona and generate additional test cases. Save
    the data.</li>
  <li> Import the file to testIDEA and run tests.</li>
  <li> (optional) Export tests with results and view results in
    Testona.</li>
  </ul>

  Note: When importing Testona file to testIDEA, information about
  rules is lost.
  

  <h3>Testona Classification Tree as created by testIDEA</h3>
  
  Information from testIDEA test cases is divided into two
  parts, when exported to Testona. All the data, which define the
  execution of tests cases (test inputs), is shown in the Testona
  Classification Tree. Compositions and classifications in this tree
  are created according to data in the selected test case,
  while classes are created according to values found in the derived
  test cases.

            <p align="center">
            <img width="90%" src="images/fullCteTree.png"/>
            </p>

  
  The Classification Tree generated by testIDEA includes:

  <ul>
    <li>function parameters</li>
    <li>test local and target global variables</li>
    <li>stub assignments and script function parameters</li>
    <li>HIL outputs</li>
    <li>script extension functions parameters</li>
  </ul>

  If any of these sections is empty in testIDEA, it is not exported.<p/>
  
  Other parts of test case, for example expected results,
  coverage and profiler sections are exported as properties of test
  cases in Testona. Each testIDEA section creates one tab, which contains
  test case data in YAML format. You are free to modify these
  data, as long as the <a href="https://www.isystem.com/downloads/winIDEA/SDK/iSYSTEM.Python.SDK/documentation/isystem-connect-api/yaml_spec.html">
  syntax</a> is valid.
  <br><p/>

            <img width="90%" src="images/cteTestCaseProperties.png"/>
            </p>

  <h3>Test cases and test groups</h3>

  Testona supports several forms of test cases and their
  grouping, while testIDEA contains only one. This section describes
  mapping of these data between testIDEA and Testona:

  <p align="center">
  <table border = "1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" width="80%">
    <tr bgcolor="#e0e0e0"><th>Testona Type</th><th>testIDEA Type</th></tr>

    <tr><td>Test Group</td><td>Base test case. Because Test
    Group in Testona can not be executed, it is recommended to
    configure base test cases as abstract ones. These test
    cases do not have marks associated so them, so in Testona we can
    modify them only via properties. </td></tr>

    <tr><td>Test Case</td><td>Derived test case.</td></tr>
    
    <tr><td>Test Sequence</td><td>Not supported by export/import.</td></tr>

    <tr><td>Test Step</td><td>Not supported by export/import.</td></tr>

  </table>

  </p>
  
  
  <h3>Editing the exported Classification Tree in Testona</h3>

  When editing the composition tree in Testona, which we plan to import
  into testIDEA, we have to be aware that the structure and names of
  compositions are fixed. They may be missing, but when present they
  must be one of:

  <ul>
    <li>the root element has a name composed of test ID and function name</li>
    <li><b>params</b> - parameters of function under test</li>
    <li><b>variables</b> - contains the <i>Variables</i> section of testIDEA</li>
    <li><b>stubs</b> - contains stubs. Its children are compositions with
    names of stubbed functions, which may have two
    compositions. The <b>assignments</b> composition contains testIDEA
    stub assignments expressions, while the <b>scriptParams</b>
    composition contains stub script extension function parameters.
    </li>
    <li><b>HIL</b> - contains HIL output parameters</li>
    <li><b>scripts</b> - this composition may have up to four children
    compositions, with names of script extension functions.
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  Classifications and classes may be modified at will. <p>

  If test case does not have some section specified, it is merged from
  parent test group on import. For example, if we create a new test
  case in Testona, it does not have variables section defined. On import,
  testIDEA first copies the variables section from the base test group
  and then executes assignments specified with marks in Testona.
  

  <h4>Function parameters</h4>

  Each function parameter is shown as one Testona class in the
  Classification Tree. Since parameters must be passed to function in 
  proper order, each class has a tag <code>paramIdx</code>, which
  determines position of parameter in parameters list. If position
  of parameter changes, we have to modify this value. Names of
  parameters are not used on import and can be freely modified.

  <h4> Variable and HIL classes </h4>
  For these classes names of Testona classes are used on import.


  <h4> Custom classifications and comments </h4>

  Custom classifications, classes and
  compositions may be added between classifications with
  parameter or variable info, and Testona class containing value, as shown
  on the image below.
  
            <p align="center">
            <img width="60%" src="images/cteCustomNodes.png"/>
            </p>

  Since custom nodes have no data representation in testIDEA, they are
  ignored and therefore can not be restored on export.<p>
  Content of tag <i>Description</i> is preserved on import from
  testIDEA, but it is currently not exported. 
  

  <h3>Test results</h3>

  When tests are executed in testIDEA, test results are also exported
  to Testona format file. To view them in Testona, right click in the
  Test Case Tree view, and select option <code>Show Columns | Test Result</code>.
  
            <p align="center">
            <img width="90%" src="images/cteTestResults.png"/>
