    <h1>Test Vector Optimization Based on Coverage</h1>

    <i>(Professional version only)</i><p>

    When coverage is the main test requirement, we can use testIDEA
    command <i>iTools | Optimize Test Vectors</i> to select test cases,
    which did not increase coverage. Then we can decide whether to delete
    them or to move them under some other base test case, which is
    executed less frequently. For example, suppose we have test cases
    <i>test-01, test-02, test-03, test-04, test-05</i>,
    and <i>test-06</i> with the following coverage statistic values:<p>

      <table>
        <tr><th>Test case ID&nbsp;&nbsp;</th><th>Coverage</th></tr>
        <tr><td>test-01</td><td>10%</td></tr>
        <tr><td>test-02</td><td>23%</td></tr>
        <tr><td>test-03</td><td>23%</td></tr>
        <tr><td>test-04</td><td>53%</td></tr>
        <tr><td>test-05</td><td>53%</td></tr>
        <tr><td>test-06</td><td>100%</td></tr>
    </table>
    
    <p>
    We can see that tests <i>test-03</i> and <i>test-05</i> have the
    same coverage statistic value as previous test, which means they
    do not execute any previously not executed code. We can select all
    such test cases with this command.
    <p>

    <h1>Usage</h1>

    The recommended way to use this feature:

    <ol>
      <li>Select a base test case, which has 
          derived test cases for the same function and with
          coverage section defined. Do not select derived test cases!</li>
      <li>Select command <i>Test | Run Selected And Derived</i> to
          execute test cases.</li>
      
      <li> After tests finish execution, and still with the base test
    selected, execute command <i>iTools | Optimize Test
    Vectors</i>.</li>
      <li>Decide what to do with the selected test cases.</li>
      </ol>

    <h1>Requirements</h2>

    To optimize a set of test vectors, test cases must first be run with
    coverage mode set to append. Only test cases, which have coverage
    defined and at least one statistics section with at least one
    statistics item criteria defined, can be considered for optimization
    process. If any of the test cases does not fulfill the condition, an
    error is issued.
