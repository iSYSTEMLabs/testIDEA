    <h1>Writing Script Extensions</h1>

    
    <h2>Script Extension Points</h2>

    When the original functionality of <i>testIDEA</i> is not enough,
    we can extend it by writing Python functions and scripts. 
    There exist three kinds of script extension points:
    <ul>
    <li><a href="#testCaseExtensions">Test case extensions</a></li>
    <li><a href="#execution">Test execution extensions</a></li>
    <li><a href="#guiExtensions">GUI extensions</a></li>
    </ul>

    All extensions should be implemented as methods in extension
    script file. The only exception are GUI script extensions, which
    are described in section <a href="#guiExtensions">GUI extensions</a>.

    
    <a name="configuration"/>
    <h2>Configuration of script environment</h2>
    Configuration for execution of scripts is accessible with command
    <span class="menuCmd">File | Properties | Scripts</span>:
        
    <p align="center">
    <img width="90%" src="images/scriptConfig.png"/>
    </p>

    Each parameter is described in its tool-tip.<p>

    <b>Note:</b> Path to Python interpreter is the same as used by
    <i>winIDEA</i>. If you need to change it, please
    see <i>winIDEA</i> dialog <span class="menuCmd">Tools |
    Options</span>, tab <span class="menuCmd">Scripts</span>.
    

    <a name="testCaseExtensions"/>
    <h2>Test case extensions</h2>
    
    These extensions can be defined for each test case. This means,
    that each test case may specify different script methods to be
    executed during test case run. These methods are defined in file
    and class specified in <a href="#configuration">configuration</a>.
    <p>

    There exist six extension points in test case:
    <ul>
      <li><b>Init target script function</b>, section <i>Scripts</i>.<br>
        Called before the test starts. No modifications of target stack are
        made up to this point, so we may run/stop the target if
        necessary. Test local variables declared in the <i>Variables</i>
        section of test case are _not_ available at this point, and
        target global variables are not modified by testIDEA. It is
        not recommended to set any variables in this function, as they
        might be overwritten by testIDEA when setting up test
        case. Use <i>Init test</i> script function for this purpose.
        If you set target global variables here, make sure they are
        not set in test case specification.        
        </li>
      
      <li><b>Init test script function</b>, section <i>Scripts</i><br>

        Called after the test is initialized, but just before the
        function under test is executed on the target. The stack on
        the target is set up at this point, and test local variables
        are created and initialized according to test specification.
        Target global and test persistent variables are initialized.
        If we need to initialize some large array, for example, this
        is the right point to do it.<br>

        Function parameters can be accessed as variables with names
        defined as:

          <pre>ic.CTestCaseController.POSITION_PARAM_NAME_PREFIX + index</pre>

        where <i>index</i> is 0 for the first parameter, 1 for the second, ...
        Example:
        <pre>  
        self.param0 = ic.CTestCaseController.POSITION_PARAM_NAME_PREFIX + '0'
        self.testCtrl.modify(self.param0, "1234")
        </pre>
        If parameter 0 is char array, we can write:
        <pre>  
        self.testCtrl.modify(self.param0 + '[1]', "'a'")
        </pre>
        The target should not be started at this point, so calls
        like <code>run()</code>, <code>stepOver()</code>,
        <code>call()</code>... from <code>CExecutionController</code> are not
        allowed here.

        </li>

      <li><b>End test script function</b>, section <i>Scripts</i><br>
        
        Called immediately after the function under test returns. The
        target state is not modified, so we can access global
        variables and test local variables on the stack. If we need to
        verify contents of arrays modified by function under test, for
        example, we should do it at this point.<br>
        
        The target should not be started at this point, so calls
        like <code>run()</code>, <code>stepOver()</code>,
        <code>call()</code>... from <code>CExecutionController</code> are not
        allowed in this script function.
        </li>

      <li><b>Restore target script function</b>, section <i>Scripts</i><br>
        Called after the test completes. The stack is cleared at this
        point, global variables are still available. Usually we do
        some final cleanup at this point, for example restore global
        variables.
      </li>
      
      <li><b>Stub script function</b>, section <i>Stubs</i><br>
        Called when the stub is executed. This function is called whenever
        the function, which we have stubbed is called. This 
        script function can be called more than once during
        one test case run. Parameters of the stubbed function are available at
        this point.
        </li>

      <li><b>Test Point script function</b>, section <i>Test points</i><br>
        Called when test point is hit. This 
        script function can be called more than once during
        one test case run. Function local variables are available at this point
        - script function can test and modify them.
        </li>
</ul>


    <h3>Writing the script extension</h3>

    Python script file with extension functions can be written
    manually from scratch, or by wizard. The description of manual
    script creation is following, while the wizard is described in
    a <a href="#scriptExtensions"> separate section</a>.
    <p>
    
    Script functions should be implemented as methods of class in
    Python module. First we create a file with extension <code>py</code>. File
    name is also the name of the module. This name should be specified
    in the <i>Imported modules</i> field in the configuration dialog
    above. This way <i>testIDEA</i> can tell Python interpreter where
    to find our code.
    <p>

    Next we write a class in the created file. It is a normal Python
    class with methods. Names of the methods must be the same as given
    in test case. The number of parameters must also match.
    <p>
    Example of class with one extension method:
    <pre>
      <b>class</b> SampleExtension:

          <b>def</b> __init__(<b>self</b>, mccMgr = None):
              pass

          <b>def</b> initTarget(<b>self</b>):
              print 'Executing initTarget()'
    </pre>
    
    Since we'll usually need <i>isystem.connect</i> calls to access
    the target, it is a good idea to import the module and initialize
    access object in extension class constructor, for example:

    <pre>
    import isystem.connect as ic

    class SampleExtension:

        def __init__(self, mccMgr = None):
            """
            Normally we'll connect to winIDEA, which is running the test, so that
            target state can be accessed/modified by this script.
            """
            if mccMgr == None:
                # Executed when called from testIDEA.
                # Connection can't be passed between processes.
                self.mccMgr = None
                self.connectionMgr = ic.ConnectionMgr()
                self.connectionMgr.connectMRU()
                self.debug = ic.CDebugFacade(self.connectionMgr)
            else:
                # Executed when called from generated script - connection is reused.
                self.mccMgr = mccMgr
                self.connectionMgr = mccMgr.getConnectionMgr('')
                self.debug = mccMgr.getCDebugFacade('')

            self.testCtrl = None

    
        def initTarget(self):
            print 'Executing initTarget()'
            for i in  range(0, 10):
                self.debug.modify(ic.IConnectDebug.fMonitor, 'g_charArray1[' + str(i) + ']',
                                  str(i*i))
    </pre>
    
    Note that for access to test local variables declared in testIDEA, we have to use
    instance of class <code>CTestCaseController</code>. See below for
    procedure of getting this object.
    
    If this class is saved to
    file <code>sampleTestExtensions.py</code>, we
    configure <i>testIDEA</i> as shown in the image above. Similar
    class can be found in Python SDK: <i>examples\winIDEA\sampleTestExtensions.py</i>.
    
    <h3>How can extension methods provide feedback?</h3>

    There are several kinds of information a method can provide, and
    each has its own purpose:

    <ul>
      <li>
      Throwing an exception indicates a failure of test execution. The
      test in testIDEA ends with exception in such case, and should be
      considered as not executed. The problem in this case lies in test
      case itself, not in the code on target.
      </li> 
      <li>
      Text printed to std out is shown in console when running tests from console,
      and in <i>Status view</i>, when tests are started from 
      <i>testIDEA</i>. This text is not shown in reports, it is intended to be used
      during test development for debugging purposes only.
      </li>
      <li>
      Function return values are the most important piece of information returned 
      by extension functions. If function returns <code>None</code>, it means no error
      and test execution continues normally. If the function returns non-empty string,
      it is considered as error in test results, and the string contents is shown
      in test reports as the reason of test failure. Make sure the
      function returns only None or string, but no other types.
      </li>
      <li>
      Reserved variables can be used to provide additional information,
      which does not mean an error. For example, value of analog voltage should be
      in range for the test to pass, but we would like to have the actual value 
      measured in the report. For such data each type of extension function has its 
      own variable. Names of these variables are composed of prefix <code>_isys_</code>,
      followed by tag used in test specification for extension function, and followed
      by postfix <code>Info</code>. All extension functions and
      corresponding variables are shown
      in the following table:<p>
      <table border = '1' cellpadding="5">
      <tr><th>Extension (tag)</th><th>Variable name</th></tr>
      <tr><td>Initialize Target (initTarget)</td><td>_isys_initTargetInfo</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Initialize Variables (initFunc)</td><td>_isys_initFuncInfo</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Verify Variables (endFunc)</td><td>_isys_endFuncInfo</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Restore Target (restoreTarget)</td><td>_isys_restoreTargetInfo</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Stubs (stub: script)</td><td>_isys_stubInfo</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Test Points (testPoint: script)</td><td>_isys_testPointInfo</td></tr>
      </table>
      <p>
      Example of setting a variable in Python script:
      <pre>
          <b>self</b>._isys_initTargetInfo = 'information from initTarget()'
      </pre> 

      Variables are set to <code>None</code> by <i>testIDEA</i> after extension function returns.
      </li>
    </ul>

    When not set to <i>None</i>, type of these variables should always be <i>string</i>.<p>
    
    Return values and info variables of each function can be seen in tool-tips of
    decorations next to extension function name in section <code>Scripts</code> in
    <i>testIDEA</i>. Red decoration means error, green one means information is available,
    while no decoration means no error and no information:


    <p align="center">
    <img width="90%" src="images/scriptResults.png"/>
    </p>

    <b>Important:</b> Standard output (print statements) should be used for
    debugging only, and script info and return values should be at
    most few lines long. This way reports and information in testIDEA UI will be
    readable. For more extensive measurements scripts should use files.
    

    <h2>How to access target variables</h2>

        One of the tasks for script functions is evaluating values of
	target variables and modifying them. By the term <i>target variables</i> this
	manual refers to one of the following:
        <ul>
        <li>global variables of the target application</li>
        <li>test local variables defined in test case
            section <i>Variables</i></li>
        <li>parameters of target function (tested or stubbed)</li>
        <li>return values of target function (tested or stubbed)</li>
        <li>local variables of the target functions (tested or stubbed)</li>
        </ul>

        All target variables can be accessed with an instance
	of <i>isystem.connect</i>
	class <code>CTestCaseController</code>. Before <i>testIDEA</i>
	calls script extension functions it sets Python variable
	<code>_isys_testCaseHandle</code> to the value of current test
	case handle. To instantiate <code>CTestCaseController</code>
	inside script extension functions use the following
	Python code:<p>
      
	<pre>
    <b>def</b> myExtFunction(<b>self</b>, testSpec):
        <b>if self</b>.testCtrl == <b>None</b>:
            <b>self</b>.testCtrl = ic.CTestCaseController(<b>self</b>.connectionMgr,
                                                   <b>self</b>._isys_testCaseHandle)
	</pre>

        To access target variables use the following example:

        <pre>
        <i># 'nItems' is the name of parameter specified in 'Parameters' field of the
        # 'Stubs' section in testIDEA. 'srv' is the name of return value as
        # specified in the same section.
        # Format specifier 'd' in 'nItems,d' ensures that the returned string 
        # always contains decimal value.
          </i>
        nItems_t = <b>int</b>(<b>self</b>.testCtrl.evaluate('nItems,d'))
        <b>print</b> 'nItems = ', nItems_t

        <b>self</b>.testCtrl.modify('srv', <b>str</b>(nItems_t * 2))
        </pre>

        <b>Tip:</b> To avoid confusion, it is highly recommended to
        use a prefix or postfix for all Python variables, which are
        related to target variables. For example, above we have used
        postfix <code>_t</code> to mark that Python variable <code>nItems_t</code>
        is related to target variable <code>nItems</code>.
        
        
        
	<h2>How to access test specification</h2>
	If test specification data in the script function is needed, then 
	the first parameter in <i>testIDEA</i> should be specified as variable 
	<code>_isys_testSpec</code>. This parameter is initialized to the instance 
	of <code>CTestSpecification</code>,
	which contains all information about the test case executed.

	<h2>Reserved identifiers</h2>

    All identifier names (variable, function, module, ... names) starting
    with string <code>_isys_</code> are reserved. It is strongly
    advised to <b>not</b> use such names for custom identifiers, to avoid
    problems with the future versions of <i>testIDEA</i>.


        <a name="scriptExtensions"/>
	<h2>Script extensions wizard</h2>
        </a>

    The wizard for script extensions is accessible with menu command <i>iTools |
    Script Extensions Wizard</i>. It creates an initial script file,
    which can be customized according to our requirements, and sets
    names of script functions in the selected test case. If
    no test case is selected, then only script is generated.

    It is recommended to create the script in the <i>winIDEA</i>
    project directory (where xjrf file is located), because then 
    Python paths for module loading do not have to be modified.

    <p align="center">
    <img width="90%" src="images/scriptExtensionsWizard.png"/>
    </p>
        
  <p/>

  <a name="execution"/>
  <h2>Test execution extensions</h2>

  These extensions are defined as methods in file and class specified
  in <a href="#configuration">configuration</a>. They are called
  at the following occasions:
  
  <ul>
        <li><b>Test case filtering</b><br/>
        The function for test filtering is specified in filter
        settings (command <code>Run | Run with filter</code>). It
        should return <b>None</b> if the test should NOT be executed,
        and any non-empty string when the test should be
        executed. Currently the string returned is not used, but in
        the future it may be stored in test reports, so the recommended
        value is description why the test was selected for execution,
        for example:
        <i>This function is part of communication module.</i>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Initialization sequence</b><br> Initialization sequence
          is defined in <span class="menuCmd">File | Properties |
          Initialization sequence</span>. It can contain several calls
          to script functions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Before saving test report</b><br/>
          Function <code>isys_getTestReportCustomData(self,
          reportConfig)</code> can be used to provide data to be used in test
          report. When implemented, it is called when user selects
          command <span class="menuCmd">Test | Save test
          report</span>, <b>before</b> the dialog opens. The function
          should set
          variable <code>self._isys_customScriptMethodInfo</code> to
          string containing <code>key: value</code> pairs, one pair
          per line. These data is then added to report <i>Test
          environment</i>. Examples of usage are revisions of tested
          components. <br> Example:<br>

          <pre>
            <b>def</b> isys_getTestReportCustomData(<b>self</b>, reportConfig):
            
                 # get revisions as mapping
                 data = {'_appRev': 12355, 'bootloaderRev': '1.05g'}

                 # create string of 'key: value' pairs suitable for test report
                 dataAsList = [(k + ': ' + str(v)) <b>for</b> k, v in data.items()]
                 self._isys_customScriptMethodInfo = '\n'.join(dataAsList)
          </pre>

          If key starts with an underscore, it is saved to test
          report, but it is <b>not</b> saved to iyaml file. Other key/value
          pairs are saved also to iyaml file.<p>

          <p align="center">
            <img width="90%" src="images/scriptProvidedDataForReport.png"/>
          </p>
            
          Return value should be <code>None</code> if no error occurred, error
          message as string otherwise.<br>
          This function has a predefined name - there is no setting in <i>testIDEA</i>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>After test report is saved</b><br/>
            Function <code>isys_afterReportSave(self, reportConfig)</code>
            can be used to post-process test report, or send/commit it
            to a database, for example. <br>
            When implemented, it is called after test report is saved.
            Return value should be <code>None</code> if no error occurred, error
            message as string otherwise.<br>
            This function has a predefined name - there is no setting in <i>testIDEA</i>.
          </li>
  </ul>

  Parameter <code>reportConfig</code> in script functions called during report saving
  contains report configuration as string in iyaml format, for example:
  <pre>

  <a name="guiExtensions"/>
  <h2>GUI extensions</h2>
  
  These script extensions appear in
  menu <span class="menuCmd">iTools</span>, and must be selected
  explicitly by user to be executed. To refresh the list in the menu,
  execute command <span class="menuCmd">iTools | Refresh</span>.
  Two kinds of GUI extensions
  exist:
  
  <ul>
    <li>Methods in extension script file</li>
    <li>Standalone scripts</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Methods in extension script file</h3>

  These methods should be defined in the script extension file and
  class, which are set in <span class="menuCmd">File | Properties |
  Scripts</span>. All methods, which start with
  prefix <b>_isys_cmd_</b> are listed in
  menu <span class="menuCmd">iTools</span>. When called, all methods
  receive name of the iyaml file in the currently active editor as
  parameter.<p>
    
  Example:

  For function output the same rules as for
  other extension functions defined in this file apply. Method result can be
  printed to stdout or stored to variable <i>self._isys_customScriptMethodInfo</i>.
  Any text printed to stderr or return value other than <i>None</i> mean
  error.

  See file <i>basicTutorialExtensions.py</i>, which comes with SDK for
  examples.

  <h3>Standalone scripts</h3>

  Python scripts (extension *.py), which are located in the same
  directory as iyaml file, are listed in the
  menu <span class="menuCmd">iTools</span>. To get script directory,
  iyaml file which was opened in an active editor when
  command <span class="menuCmd">iTools | Refresh</span> was executed,
  is used.<p>

  To avoid inconveniently long lists in the menu, scripts are sorted
  alphabetically, and only the first ten are used. One possible
  naming convention for scripts, which we want to run from testIDEA,
  would be to start their names with an underscore ('_') character.
  <p>

    Scripts can be run in three modes:
    <ul>
      
      <li>Synchronous mode. This is the default mode. <i>testIDEA</i>
      waits until the script is executed, and prints its output in
      Status view after script execution. Timeout set
      in <span class="menuCmd">File | Properties | Scripts</span>
      applies here.</li>
      
      <li>Asynchronous mode. This mode is used, when SHIFT key is hold
      down when script is selected in the menu. Script is run in
      standalone console window, which is closed after the script
        executes. No output is available in testIDEA.</li>
      
      <li>Asynchronous interactive mode. This mode is used, when SHIFT
      and CTRL keys are hold down when script is selected in the
        menu. Script is run in standalone console window, which remains
      opened with Python prompt when the script ends execution.</li>
    </ul>
