    <h1>Test results</h1>

    After test execution status of each test is marked with green or
    red overlay icons. Status icons are set also on each section of test
    case, which has results set. Note that not all sections
    define constraints on test results. Only the following pages
    define such constraints:

    <ul>
      <li><b>Pre-conditions</b><br/>
        Expressions in this sections are evaluated before the target
        is started. They can be used to verify initial conditions for
        the test.
        
      <li><b>Expected</b><br/>

        This section cen define stack usage contraints and
      expressions.
      Expressions defined in table <i>Expressions</i> must evaluate to
      non-zero value. If this is not true, expression is marked with
      red icon. When we click an expression, values of sub-expressions
      are shown below the table <i>Expected</i>, as shown below.

      <p align="center">
          <img src="images/expressionsResults.png"/>
      </p>

      We can see not only that the results of the expression was <i>false</i>,
      but also the actual value returned from the function.
      <br/>
      <b>Note 1:</b> Hex or Dec mode for values printed can be set either in:
      <ul>
      <li><i>winIDEA</i> watch window, tool-bar button <code>'0xF'</code>.</li>
      <li>by appending format specifiers to expression (using 
          symbols <code>@@</code>, see tool-tip of the expressions table).
          </li>
      <li><i>testIDEA</i> settings in  <code>File | Properties | Evaluator</code>.</li>
      </ul>
      <b>Note 2:</b> For floating point values the operator '==' must be used 
      with caution. To make comparison for equality of floating point values
      more convenient, <i>winIDEA</i> uses vague comparison, where values are 
      considered equal, if their relative difference is less than <i>epsilon</i>.
      The default value of <i>epsilon</i> is 1.e-5, but can be customized with 
      winIDEA option <code>/IDE/Debug.Symbols.Format.VagueFloatPrecision</code>.
      Enter this option URL and new <i>epsilon</i> value 
      in <i>testIDEA</i> section <code>Options</code>. Alternatively this value is 
      accessible in <i>winIDEA</i> <code>Debug | Debug Options</code> dialog, tab <code>Symbol</code>.
      </li>

      <li><b>Stubs</b><br/>
        When stubbed function is called, <i>testIDEA</i> can verify
        values of variables and run scripts. Expressions and scripts
        must be successful for test to pass.
        
      <li><b>Test points</b><br/>
        Test points can pause test execution anywhere inside the
        function. <i>testIDEA</i> can verify values of variables and
        run scripts at these locations. Expressions and scripts must
        be successful for test to pass.
        
      <li><b>Scripts</b><br/>
        Scripts also have possibility to report errors to <i>testIDEA</i>.
        
      <li><b>Coverage</b><br/>

      Coverage section may define minimum amount of coverage for
      functions called during test. After test execution the
      requirements, which were not satisfied, are marked with red
      color.
      </li>

      <li><b>Profiler</b><br/>
      
      Profiler section may define execution times and hit counts for
      functions called and variables modified during test. After test
      execution the requirements, which were not satisfied, are marked
      with red color.
      </li>

      <li><b>Extension functions</b><br/>

      Extension functions can also report errors. In such case red decoration
      icons appear next to script function name in the <i>Scripts</i> section.
      </li>
    </ul>

    
    <h1>Test results in the Status view</h1>

    After the test execution the summary of test results is shown in
    the <i>Status view</i>. The first line shows some statistic, while
    other lines contain errors, if they occurred.<p>

    Example of the <i>Status View</i> without errors:
      <p align="center">
          <img width="90%" src="images/statusViewWithoutErrors.png"/>
      </p></li>

    Example of the <i>Status View</i> with errors:
      <p align="center">
          <img width="90%" src="images/statusViewWithErrors.png"/>
      </p></li>

    <b>Tip:</b> To see the test case, which has failed, double click
    the error line in the <i>Status view</i>. The corresponding test case will be
    selected in the <i>Test tree</i>.
    

    
    <h1>Test reports</h1>

    <i>(Professional version only)</i><p>

    To save test results for documentation purposes, red marks in GUI
    are not very convenient. For this reason we can save test results
    to file in several different formats.
    <i>iSYSTEM testIDEA</i> can save test results in XML, YAML, CSV,
    XLS, or XLSX file formats.<p>
    
    <b>XML</b> format is convenient for usage in other tools, including
    viewing in web browsers, because it is widely supported.<p>
    
    <b>YAML</b> format is not so well known, but it
    is much more readable and as such convenient for quick overview in
    text editor.<p>
    
    <b>CSV</b> (Comma Separated Values) format is also understood by many
    other tools, for example it can be imported to rquirements
    management tools, such as DOORS.<p>

    <b>XLS</b> and <b>XLSX</b> are Excel (old and new) formats.

    We can show XML file in web browser with the help of XML
    Stylesheet Template. This section describes generating of reports,
    while XSLTs are described in section <a href =
    "../tasks/xsltAndCss.html">iSYSTEM Test Report Stylesheets</a>
    <p/>

    Test report can be saved with the main menu option <code>Test |
    Save Test Report ...</code>. We get the following dialog:

      <p align="center">
          <img src="images/saveTestReport.png"/>
      </p></li>

    As usual, description of input fields is given in their
    tool-tips.<p>

  <b>Note:</b> Internet Explorer does not support document created
  with option <i>Embed XSLT/CSS into XML report</i> checked. See
  <a href='https://connect.microsoft.com/IE/feedback/details/789934/ie-10-xml-and-embed-xslt'>
    IE 10, XML and embed XSLT</a> for more details.<p>
  
    An example of the generated test report is shown
    below. First we can see a table with test configuration
    parameters, and a table with test statistic. Tables with results
    of each executed test case are following.

      <p align="center">
          <img width="90%" src="images/testReportExample.png"/>
      </p></li>

    Because one test can fail with more than one error, the sum of number
    of errors per category can be greater than the number of failed
    tests in the statistic table.

    <h2>Coverage results</h2>

    Coverage report contains the following results:

    <ul>
        <li><i>Obj. code all</i> - the number of object code statements in the measured code</li>
        <li><i>Src. lines all</i> - the number of all source lines in the measured code</li>
        <li><i>Cond. all</i> - the number of all conditions in the measured code</li>
        <li><i>CC (Outomes)</i> - condition coverage measured in all
        possible outcomes. The number of all possible outcomes is the
        number of conditions times 2, because each condition has 2
        outomes (true and false). For measured outcomes the following
        equation is used:<br>
          <code>measured outcomes = cond. false only + cond. true only
          + cond. both ways * 2</code></li>
        
        <li><i>Obj. code executed</i> - expected and measured percentage of
        executed statements in object code</li>
        
        <li><i>Src. lines executed</i> - expected and measured percentage of
        executed source lines</li>
        
        <li><i>Conditions any</i> - the number of conditions, which executed
        at least once</li>
        
        <li><i>Cond. true only</i> - the number of conditions, which
        evaluated to true only</li>
        
        <li><i>Cond. false only</i> - the number of conditions, which
        evaluated to false only</li>
        
        <li><i>Conditions both</i> - the number of conditions, which
        evaluated both ways (true and false)</li>
    </ul>
