    <h1>Test cases in C/C++ source files</h1>

    Unit tests are tightly related to specific sections of source code,
    usually this means each tests belongs to one function. Therefore it
    makes sense to keep test specifications in the same file with source
    code. To make this possible, <i>testIDEA</i> can parse special C/C++
    comments, which contain test specifications. Comments must start with
    string '/*#', which is a standard C/++ multi-line comment followed by
    '#'. Example:

    <pre>
    /*#
    - func: [min_int, [], rv]
      params: [3, 5]
      expect:
      - rv == 3
    */

    int min_int(int a, int b)
    {
      if (a < b)
        return a;

      return b;
    }
    </pre>

    This way we can easily adapt tests to any changes in the source
    code. Of course it is also possible to have more than one test
    specification in one comment block.
    <p>

    Test specifications can be edited either directly in the source
    code editor, or the source code file is opened and edited in
    <i>testIDEA</i>. <i>testIDEA</i> modifies only test specifications
    in the special code comments, while the rest of the file is left
    intact. <i>testIDEA</i> also does not add any new test comments to
    the source file - all test specifications are stored into the
    existing comments. Therefore it is a good idea to tell <i>testIDEA</i>
    where to put test specifications by manually adding short test 
    comments to places, where we want to have test specification. For
    example, the following snippet shows test specification added
    manually - the rest will be specified in <i>testIDEA</i>:

    <pre>
    /*#
       - id: min
     */

    int min_int(int a, int b)
    {
      if (a < b)
        return a;

      return b;
    }
    </pre>

    
<h1>Rules for source code test comments</h1>

<ol>
<li>
   Test comments must start with /*#. These three characters must be
   the first non-space characters in the line. Example:<p>

   Valid:
   <pre>
   /*# - func: [f, [], rv] */
   </pre>

   Not valid:
   <pre>
   a = 3; /*# - func: [f, [], rv] */
   // <i>testIDEA</i> will ignore such test specifications.
   </pre>

   Similar applies to the end of comment token '*/'. It must the
   last token in line. The following is not valid:

   <pre>
   /*# - func: [f, [], rv] */ a = 3;
   </pre>

   testIDEA will report an error in such case.<p>

   Test specification may start immediately in the same line as
   comment start, but for readability purposes it is recommended to
   start it on a new line:

   <pre>
   /*#
       - func: [f, [], rv] 
    */
   </pre>

   <b>Note:</b> If there is more than one line in test spec, it is highly
     recommended to start test spec on the line after comment start for
     readability reasons. The following is NOT recommended:

   <pre>
   /*# - func: [f]
      expect:
      - rv == 0
    */
   </pre>
   
</li>


<li>
   <i>testIDEA</i> loads files with extension <i>iyaml</i> as pure
   YAML files. If the file has any other extension, it is loaded as
   source code file, where test specifications are stored in special
   source code comments, as described in this section.<p>

   If file is opened as <i>iyaml</i> file, it is not possible to save
   it as source code file, because it contains no source
   code. However, if it is opened as source code file, we can save it
   as <i>iyaml</i> file (the source code is not saved).<p>
</li>


<li>
   Indentation may differ between comments, but it must be
   consistent inside one comment.<p>
</li>


<li>
   Tabs inside test specifications are forbidden.
   See: <a href="http://www.yaml.org/faq.html">http://www.yaml.org/faq.html</a>.
   It is not a good idea to use tabs in source code anyway.<p>
</li>


<li>
   Hierarchy of test specifications can be defined in one of two ways:
   <ul>
     <li>
     Use inheritance inside one test specifications comment, for example:
     <pre>
     - id: ts1
       func: [g, [45], rv]
       expect: [rv == 90]
       tests:
         id: ts1-a
         params: 50
         expect: [rv == 100]
      </pre>
      </li>
     
     <li>
     Use tag <i>baseId</i> to define the base test specification,
     which may be defined in some other test specification comment,
     for example:
     
     <pre>
       - id: ts1-b
         baseId: ts1
         params: 60
         expect: [rv == 120]
      </pre>

      <p>
      The <i>baseId</i> tags assigned to test specifications, which
      are already derived in the comment, are ignored. For example, if
      the test specifications with id <i>ts1-a</i> in the example
      above, would have the <i>baseId</i> tag defined, this tag would
      be ignored.

      <p>
      The base test specification may be defined later in the source
      file.

      <p>
      If more than one test specification with id equal to the <i>baseId</i>
      exist, the first one declared is used as a base test
      specification.

      <p>
      If base test spec A is defined after derived test specs, derived
      test specs are appended to the list of derived test specs in the
      order as they appear in the file. Exception to this rule are
      derived test specs defined immediately as children of A in the
      same test comment - they are the first ones.

      <p>
      Although testIDEA allows flexibility in defining test
      specifications, it is recommended to define test specifications
      in their natural order when possible. For example, it is allowed
      to define base test specification in a comment that follows its
      derived tests specifications. However, for readability reasons we
      should define base test specification before its derived test
      specifications, whenever possible. This flexibility is available
      for cases, when other aspects of function organization inside
      source code file have stronger impact on readability and clarity.
      </li>
     </ul><p>
   </li>

<li>
 Test configuration must start with special comment /*~.
   There may be only one such comment in one source file.<p>
</li>


<li>
   <i>testIDEA</i> never changes anything outside of test comments. Inside test
   comments testIDEA tries to do its best to keep the formatting of test
   specifications intact. For example, if you open the source code
   file and then save it without changes, indentation of test
   specifications does not change. However there are two cases, when
   formatting changes (semantic is preserved!):

   <ul>
     <li>
       The first case is when there are base and derived test
       specification defined in the same comment, but they are linked
       with tag <i>baseId</i>, not hierarchically. When saved, they are saved
       in hierarchy, not linked with <i>baseId</i>. For example, if the
       comment contains:

       <pre>
       /*#
          - id: testA
            func: [min_int, [56, 89], rvf]
            expect:
            - rvf == 56
     
          - baseId: testA
            func: [max_int, [99, 999], rvm]
            expect:
            - rvm == 999
        */
       </pre>

       then the saved comment will be:

       <pre>
       /*#
          - id: testA
            func: [min_int, [56, 89], rvf]
            expect:
            - rvf == 56
            tests:
            - func: [max_int, [99, 999], rvm]
              expect:
              - rvm == 999
        */
        </pre>
     </li>
     <li>
       The second case is when the order of derived test
       specifications linked to base test specifications with tag
       <i>baseId</i> does not match the order of base test
       specifications. Derived test specifications are
       always saved in the same order as base test specifications,
       because this is also their execution order.
       For example:

       If comments contain:
        <pre>
        /*#
          - id: testA
            func: [min_int, [56, 89], rvf]
            expect:
            - rvf == 56
     
          - id: testB
            func: [max_int, [99, 999], rvm]
            expect:
            - rvm == 999
        */

       /*#
          - baseId: testB
            params: [59, 99]
            expect:
            - rvf == 59
     
          - baseId: testA
            params: [199, 1999]
            expect:
            - rvm == 1999
        */
        </pre>

        the first comment will be unchanged, while the second one will
        be saved as:

        <pre>
       /*#
          - baseId: testA
            params: [199, 1999]
            expect:
            - rvm == 1999
     
          - baseId: testB
            params: [59, 99]
            expect:
            - rvf == 59
        */
       </pre>
       
</ol>
