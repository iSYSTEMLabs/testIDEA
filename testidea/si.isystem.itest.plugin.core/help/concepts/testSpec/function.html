    <h1>Function</h1>

    This test section is available only for unit tests, which means
    testing of a single function in <i>testIDEA</i>. For this kind of
    tests, target stack is modified in a way, which enables calling of the
    specified function, and stopping execution when the function
    returns.<br>
    
    This page contains the most important part of unit test specification -
    the name of the function to be tested, and its parameters. 

    <p align="center">
    <img width="90%" src="images/function.png"/>
    </p>

    It is recommended that <i>winIDEA</i> has symbols loaded
    and <i>testIDEA</i> is connected to winIDEA. This way content
    assistance is available, and function prototypes are shown in
    testIDEA.
    <p/>
    <i>Timeout</i> specifies when testIDEA terminates test case
    execution, if it does not end normally. See tooltip for more details.
    
    
    <h4>Fully qualified function names</h4>

    If there are multiple download files, or we use file static
    functions, multiple functions with the same name may exist. To
    define the exact function, we can use the extended syntax for
    function naming:

    <pre>
    "&lt;sourceFile&gt#"&lt;functionName&gt,,&lt;downloadFile&gt
    </pre>

     where:
     <ul>
     <li> <code>moduleName</code> - name of the C source file, which
     contains the function (optional)</li>
     <li> <code>functionName</code> - name of the function</li>
     <li> <code>downloadFileName</code> - name of the download file,
     where the function is located</li>
     </ul>
     
    Example:
    
    <pre>
    "calc.c#"add,,math.elf
    </pre>

    The source file name is needed only for file static functions, for
    all other functions we can specify only download file, for example:

    <pre>
    add,,math.elf
    </pre>

    
    The setting for using fully qualified or simple function names in
    content proposals is located in <i>testIDEA</i> <code>File |
    Properties | General</code> dialog, check-box <i>Use qualified
    function names</i>.
<p>    

    <h4>Inlined functions</h4>
    There exists also special notation for inlined functions, which
    specifies hex address, "###" and function name, for example: 
    <pre>
     "080023AA###"calculate
    </pre>
    
    Since these are not regular functions, they can not be used by testIDEA
    as tested functions, stubs, user stubs, or profiler areas. 

    <h4>Overloaded functions and methods</h4>

    To specify which of overloaded functions has to be tested, add
    also list of parameter types to function name, for example:

    <pre>
    "Vehicle.cpp#"testOverloads(long,long)
    </pre>
    
    Name of the source file is not mandatory.
