    <h1><i>System init</i> and <i>Execute test</i></h1>

    These two sections define start point and
    test execution for tests, which test something else than a single
    function, for example few lines of code, a set of functions, a set
    of modules or complete system. This section is visible,
    if <a href="../systemTests.html"><i>System tests</i></a> are
    selected in <i>Meta</i> page.<p>

    The <i>System init</i> section specifies where to stop the
    target before test. It does not need to be specified, if target is
    already initialized and execution point set as expected.<p>

    The <i>Execute test</i> section must be specified if we want the
    test to be executed by <i>testIDEA</i>. If it is not specified
    (option <i>No exec</i> is selected), then script function <a href='scripts.html'><i>Init
    test</i></a> should be specified, and should run and stop the target
    to execute the test.  
      When target stops, target state (variables, ...) is obtained and compared to tests
    requirements. Analyzer is also stopped and expected values verified.
