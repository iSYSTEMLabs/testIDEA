    <h1>Expected results and Stack usage</h1>

    The table <i>Expressions</i> can contain expressions, which are evaluated
    after the test execution ends. All valid C expressions can be
    used.<br>
    We can test the following data:
    <ul>
      <li>function return value, for example: <code>rv == 34</code></li>
      <li>variables declared in the variables section, for example: <code>*ptr == 42</code></li>
      <li>target global variables</li>
      <li>target registers by using prefix '@', for example: <code>@R3 == 42</code></li>
      <li>IO module inputs by using back quotes as a prefix,
          for example: <code>`DigitalIn.DIN0 == 1</code></li>
    </ul>

    See also the tool tip of the table (place mouse cursor over the table header).

    <h2>Exceptions</h2>

    Some languages support exceptions for error handling. If
    option <i>Expect target exception</i> is selected, then testIDEA
    handles exception as an expected test outcome. This can be used
    for example, when we want to test error handling in our code.
    To evaluate thrown exception object, internal variable
    <i>isystem_test_exception</i> can be used in the <i>Expressions</i>
    table.
    
    <h1>Stack usage</h1>

    Stack memory is always a limited resource, and problems related to
    overlapping data and stack region are hard to find, and can produce
    everything from strange non-reproducible target behavior to fatal
    crashes. <br>
    
    With <i>testIDEA</i> we can measure and test amount of stack used
    by code executed in test. The information is not retrieved from
    debug info, but it is measured by counting unmodified stack memory
    locations.<p>

    To measure stack usage, we must first configure stack addresses
    and seeding pattern in <i>testIDEA</i> <code>File | Properties | Stack
    usage </code> page:

    <p align="center">
    <img width="90%" src="images/stackUsageConfig.png"/></p>

    Stack base address (<i>baseAddr</i>) is the lowest address we
    expect to be used for stack, and Stack end address (<i>endAddr</i>) is the
    last address - top of the stack, usually stack pointer is set to
    this value at target init.<br>
    If we expect less stack to be used during test that it is actually
    available, we can enter higher base address - test will still
    pass, but execution will be a bit faster since less memory needs
    to be analyzed.<p>

    Seeding <i>pattern</i> is a byte value written to unused stack
    area. <i>testIDEA</i> reads stack memory area after test, and
    considers locations with other values to be used for stack during
    test.<p>

    Once we've configured stack measurements, we can specify the
    maximum allowed amount of stack used for each test:

    <p align="center">
    <img width="90%" src="images/stackUsageTest.png"/></p>

    <p><br><p>
    Test reports contain also amounts of stack used before the test
    started, amount used by testIDEA for test local variables, and the
    actual amount used by application code under test.
    <p>

      
    <b>Limitations</b><p>
    
    <i>Seeding pattern</i><p>
    Since the pattern used for stack initialization can occur
    also in normal program execution, this approach may not be 100%
    accurate in all cases. However, probability that it will give
    wrong results for more than few bytes is very small, and depends
    also on selection of seeding pattern in <code>File | Properties |
    Stack usage</code>. It is recommended to use a pattern, which can
    not be valid address. For example, if our target has no memory or
    other addressable items at 0xCCCCCCCC, then 0xCC is a good choice.
    <p>

    <i>Stack overflow</i><p>

    <i>testIDEA</i> can measure stack usage under normal conditions,
    when there is still some space on the stack left. Stack overflows
    will not be detected. This is normally not a problem for unit
    tests, as single function usually uses much less space than there
    is used during normal application run.<p>

    <i>Recursion</i><p>
    Stack usage in case of recursion heavily depends on values of
    input parameters, so successful tests of recursive functions do
    not guarantee limited stack usage.
