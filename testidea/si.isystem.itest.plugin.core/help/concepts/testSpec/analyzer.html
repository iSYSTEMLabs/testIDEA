    <h1>Common analyzer configuration</h1>

    Section <i>Analyzer</i> contains data for code execution
    analysis: code coverage, profiler, and trace. This section
    contains only configuration common to all three subsections.

    <i>Note:</i> Append mode is currently available for coverage
    only. Profiler and trace data are removed on each start.

    To create distinct analyzer file name for each test case, we
    can use host variables in field <i>Document file</i>. If we type
    <b>$</b>, a list of porposals with available host variables is
    shown. Select a variable and its description will appear.<p>
      For example, if file name is defined as
      <pre>

      ${_testId}-${_function}.trd

      </pre>
    then the two variables will be replaced with current test ID and
    the name of function under test. This way each test case gets analyzer
    file with different but meaningful name.
