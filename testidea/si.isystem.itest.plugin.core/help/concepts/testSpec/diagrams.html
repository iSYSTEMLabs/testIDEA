    <h1>Diagrams</h1>

    This section contains configurations for diagrams, which can be
    created based on information produced during test case execution,
    or other sources. Term <i>diagram</i> in this text means all types
    of graphical information, including graphs, charts, ...<p>

      <b>Requirement:</b> For sequence diagrams module <i>seqdiag</i>
      has to be installed in Python used by winIDEA. It is already
      present in winIDEA's internal Python, so if you have selected
      in winIDEA <i>Tools | Options | Script | Internal Python x.y</i>, then
      there should be no problems. If you have selected one of the
      other two options in this dialog to use your installation of
      Python, then you have to install the module <i>seqdiag</i>
      yourself. See <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/seqdiag/">
      https://pypi.python.org/pypi/seqdiag/</a> for installation.<p><br>
      

    <p align="center">
        <img width="95%" src="images/diagrams.png"/>
    </p>
    
    Columns in the diagram configuration table have the following
    meaning:
    <ul>
      <li><code>isActive</code> - if checked, and complete section is
        enabled with check-box <i>Is active</i>, the diagram will be
        created during test execution. After test execution you can
        always create a diagram with button <i>Create</i>, regardless
        of this setting.
      </li>

      <li><code>diagramType</code> - this column contains one of
      built-in diagram types or defines a custom diagram type. In the
      later case the script name should be specified in the next
        column.<br>

        There exist two types of custom diagrams - the
      normal <i>custom</i> type and type <i>custom-async</i>. As the
      name already implies, the later type of scripts is executed
      asynchronously, which means that testIDEA does not wait for
      results. This type of diagrams can be used when the script
      itself displays the diagram, and we prefer viewing it in new
      windows. These diagrams can not be included in reports.

      <li><code>script</code> - for custom diagrams this column
      specifies name of Python script to be executed to draw a
        diagram. It is ignored for built-in diagrams. 
        
      </li>

      <li><code>params</code> - this column specifies script
      parameters, if they are required. For built-in diagrams
      this column should be empty.
      </li>

      <li><code>outFile</code> - this column specifies name of the
      file, which will contain the diagram. It is mandatory, and may
        contain host variables
        <code>${_testId}</code>, <code>${_function}</code>,
        and <code>${_diagramType}</code>. If file name is relative
        (recommended),
        diagrams are saved relative to test report directory. It is
        highly recommended to specify test report file with command
        <code>Test | Configure Test Report</code> before running
        tests.
        For built-in diagrams the value of '_diagramType' is the name of
        built-in type, for custom diagrams, it is string 'custom'.
        If two lines have the same output file name,
        warning is written in Status view.    
      </li>

      <li><code>isAddToReport</code> - if checked, the link to diagram
      file is included in test report, when saved. Diagrams of type
      <i>custom-async</i> can not be added to test report. Diagram files
        are part of test report, so they must not be deleted to be
        shown in report.
      </li>

      <li><code>viewer</code> - for quick preview, diagrams are shown
      in the bottom pane of the <i>Diagrams</i> test case section. For
      better view, we can open them as documents, either as one
      diagram per tab (<i>singlePage</i>) , or as one tab in
      multi-page document (<i>multiPage</i>). <i>externalApp</i> opens
      diagram image in an external application.
      </li>

      <li><code>dataFormat</code> - testIDEA can show diagrams saved
      to bitmap file formats (<i>png</i> is recommended) and vector format (only
      <i>svg</i> is supported). The recommended value for this column
      is <i>byExtension</i> and specified extension <i>png</i>
      or <i>svg</i> in output file. Both formats are supported by
      matplotlib and graphwiz, and can be shown by web browsers in
      test report. Other formats may not be shown in web browser.
      </li>

      <li><code>externalViewer</code> - if output format is not
      supported by testIDEA, or for some other reason we want to see
      a diagram in external application, we can specify its
      name here. If <i>externalApp</i> is selected in column <i>viewer</i>,
      then Button <i>Show</i> will open the output file
      with this application. If <i>externalApp</i> is selected, but
      this field is empty, then default system viewer for the given
      output file extension will be used.
      </li>
      </ul>

    Tips:
    <ol>
      <li>To generate diagram during test case execution, check-box
        <i>Is active</i> and table column <i>isActive</i> must both be
        checked. Button <i>Create</i> generates a diagram regardless
        of these two settings.</li>


      <li>If a diagram is produced by script extension or
        stub/test-point script during test case execution, then add
        new line to table, set diagram type to <i>custom</i>, leave
        <i>script</i> column empty, and specify file name. </li>

      <li>If one script produces more than one file, add new line to
        table, set diagram type to <i>custom</i>, leave <i>script</i>
        column empty, and specify file name. This way it is also
        possible to show the same file in multiple viewers, for
        example internal testIDEA viewer and external viewer.</li>

      <li>
        When opening diagrams in multi-page editor, text on tab on the
        bottom of the page is taken from file name as text before
        extension, and after the last '-', for example:
        <code>test-0-myFunc-callGraph.png ==> callGraph</code>. To get
        full file name as tab name, replace all '-' in file name with
        some other character, for example underscore.</li>
    </ol>    
    
    
<h2>Built-in diagrams</h2>

testIDEA contains the following types of built-in diagrams:
    <p>
    <b>Flow chart</b><br>
      This chart is created from <b>static object code
      analysis</b>. Test does not need to be run to get information
      for this diagram, but the code has to be downloaded to the target.

    <p>
    <b>Call graph</b><br>
    This diagram shows which function has called which function, and
    how many times this call has been executed. It shows runtime
    information, which is obtained from profiler recording. Profiler has to be
    properly configured for this diagram (see button <i>Auto-configure
    profiler</i>) and the test executed.

    <p>
    <b>Static call graph</b><br>
    This diagram shows function call hierarchy. It shows static
    information obtained from download file, so the test does not need
    to be run to create this graph.<p>
    Parameters:<br>
    <code>-t</code> : By default functions called form the function under test are
    shown. If we specify this parameter, then functions
    which call function under test are shown. <br>
    <code>-d &lt;n&gt;</code> : By default complete hierarchy is
    shown. By specifying depth value, we can limit call depth shown. 
    
    <p>
    <b>Sequence diagram</b><br>
    This diagram shows UML sequence diagram - function calls in the
    same sequence as they occurred.

    <p>
    <b>Flame graph</b><br>

    This graph shows time spent in each call stack. The detailed
    description is available at
    <a href="http://www.brendangregg.com/FlameGraphs/cpuflamegraphs.html">CPU
      Flame Graphs</a>, except that testIDEA shows execution time,
      not execution count.<p>
    Summary adapted for testIDEA flame graphs:<ul>
    <li>Each box represents a function in the stack (a "stack frame").</li>
    <li>The y-axis shows stack depth (number of frames on the
      stack). The top box shows the running function. Boxes below show
      functions, which called the function above them.</li>
    <li>The x-axis <b>does not show the passing of time</b> from left to
      right. The left to right ordering has no meaning (it's sorted
      alphabetically).</li>
    <li>The width of the box shows the total execution time for
      sequence of stack frames at and above the box.</li>
    <li>The same function may appear more than once in the graph, if
        it is called from different functions.</li>
    <li>Precision of execution times depends on On-Chip trace
      module. Typically it is low for short functions.</li>
    </ul>

    <i>Example:</i><br>
    Suppose we have the following code:
    <pre>
      g() {}
      
      h() {}
      
      a() {
          g();
      }
      
      b() {
          g();
          h();
          g();
      }

      f() {
          b();
          b();
          a();
      }
      </pre>

    Flame graph with added explanations is shown below. It can be seen
    that two calls of <code>b()</code> and four calls
    of <code>g()</code> are merged together. Call stacks are shown in
    alphabetical order, not execution order.

        <img width="95%" src="images/flameExample.png"/>
    </p>

    <i>Script parameters</i><br>
    See tool-tip in table in section <i>Diagrams</i> for most useful parameters.
    To see all possible parameters and their values, run the script
    from command line:
    <pre>
        python <pyInstallDir>/Lib/site-packages/isystem/flameGraph.py -h
    </pre>

    Note that title, profiler export, and output file name are already
    specified by testIDEA.<p>

    <i>Interactivity</i><br>
    Flame graphs are interactive, which means clicking a function box
    performs zoom. Unfortunately testIDEA SVG viewer does not support
    these features, so it is recommended to open it in javascript
    capable SVG viewer, for example Firefox or Chrome web browser (IE
    and Edge do not support all functionality). In table with diagrams
    select <i>externalApp</i> in column <i>viewer</i>, and enter path to your browser
    in column <i>externalViewer</i>:

    </p>
    
    

<h2>Directories</h2>
    
    Files in testIDEA (analyzer output and export files, scripts,
    reports, images, ...) can be specified with relative or absolute
    paths. When relative paths are specified, the so called <i>working
    directory</i> (this is directory where relative path starts) depends
    on file type:
    <ul>
      <li>Analyzer files are saved relative to winIDEA workspace directory, because
        they are created by winIDEA.</li>
      
      <li>Scripts created by testIDEA are also saved relative to
        winIDEA workspace directory, so that they have access to
        analyzer output files.

      <li>Test report is saved relative to iyaml file directory.</li>

      <li>Diagram images are created in directory relative to report
        file directory,
        so report file should be specified before test run, if it is going to
        be located in directory other than iyaml file.</li>
    </ul>

      
<h2>Scripts for diagrams</h2>
      
    testIDEA already contains Python scripts for built-in diagrams. On
    request for drawing a diagram, the script is saved to winIDEA
    workspace directory.<br>
    Script files for built-in scripts always start with prefix <i>_isys_</i>,
    for example <i>_isys_flowChart.py</i>. <b>Never modify these scripts,</b> as
    they will be overwritten by testIDEA. Always rename them, and use
    them as custom scripts if you want to customize them.<p>


<h2>Custom scripts</h2>

<h3>How to write custom scripts</h3>

To write custom scripts it is highly recommended to generate template
script with button <i>GW template</i> or <i>MP template</i>. The first
button generates a template script which uses <i>graphwiz</i> utility, the
second one uses <i>matplotlib</i>. As comments in generated scripts suggest,
use provided function for command line argument parsing. If arguments
will change in future versions of testIDEA, it will not be necessary to
update all custom scripts.
    <p/>

    <h2>Description of custom script parameters</h2>

Several optional parameters and one positional are provided to custom
scripts. Optional parameters are available only if the item is
specified in test case.

    <ul>
      <li><code>args.dotDir</code> - directory with graphwiz tools
      bundled with winIDEA.
      </li>
      <li><code>args.testID</code> - test ID of the executed test case
      </li>
      <li><code>args.functionName</code> - name of function under test
      </li>
      <li><code>args.cvrgExport</code> - name of coverage export file
      </li>
      <li><code>args.profExport</code> - name of profiler export file
      </li>
      <li><code>args.traceExport</code> - name of trace export file
      </li>
      <li><code>args.analyzerDoc</code> - name of analyzer document (<i>trd</i> file)
      </li>
      <li><code>args.outFileName</code> - name of image file. This
        parameter is always present, and is always the last item
        specified in command line, even if user arguments are provided.
      </li>
      </ul>


    In order to run scripts for diagrams from testIDEA and Python test
    script, scripts for diagrams should use the following rules:
        
        <ul>
          <li>It should import <code>_isys_diagutils</code>. This
              module is created by testIDEA, when you create a
              template. Never modify this module, because it is
              repeatedly overwritten by testIDEA when you create
              template scripts!
            
          <li>It must define function <code>main(args)</code>, and call it
              with command line arguments, as shown below:
            
        <pre>
        import sys
        import _isys_diagutils

        def main(cmdLineArgs):

            args = _isys_diagutils.parseArgs(cmdLineArgs, None)

            < ... your code ... >


        if __name__ == '__main__':
            main(sys.argv[1:])
        </pre>
        
              See documentation in source code of template scripts for more information.
          </li>
        </ul>
    
        
    Test case with diagrams should be started at least once from testIDEA,
    so that built-in scripts are copied from testIDEA resources to winIDEA
    working directory.


    <h3>Script return values</h3>

    The script should return 0, if it created diagram image
    successfully, any other number otherwise. It is a good practice to
    throw an exception with informative error message in case of
    failure, so that user gets more information about the
    problem. Throwing an exception in Python automatically returns
    non-zero value.
