    <h1>Coverage</h1>

    Coverage section can specify coverage statistics requirements, and
    export options.

    <br> Coverage also supports accumulation of results from several
    tests, if we select open mode <i>Append</i> in <i>Analyzer</i>
    parent setion. To use this feature, we usually create a base test
    case, which opens the document in <i>Write</i> mode, so that any
    previous coverage data is cleared. Then derived test cases are
    created, which start coverage in <i>Append</i> mode.

    Another option for accumulation of coverage recordings is merging
    of analyzer files. If <i>Merge scope</i> is set to something else
    than <i>None</i>, then analyzer files from other already executed
    test cases will be merged. To see which test cases are used for
    merging, click <i>Edit</i> button for merge filter.The filter can
    be used to futher limit the set of test cases.<p>
    
    
    Expected minimum coverage can be specified in
    section <i>Statistics<i>. If coverage is lower than specified,
    test fails.
