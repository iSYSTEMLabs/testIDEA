    <h1>Derived test cases</h1>

    Often we want to group tests based on some common property, for
    example on function to be tested. Such tests also usually share at
    least some test case sections. To provide this functionality,
    tests can be organized hierarchically in a tree structure. Tests
    on the top level of the tree are called <b>base tests</b>, while
    their children are called <b>derived tests</b>.
    <p/>

    Derived tests inherit all test sections from their
    parents by default, but they can also override them.
    The sections, which are specified in derived tests (overridden),
    are not inherited from base test case.
    <p/>

    <p/>
    <b>Example:</b> Suppose we have a test case with
    several sections defined:

    <p align="center">
    <img width="90%" src="images/derivedTestSpec1.png"/>
    </p>

    If we add a derived test case, it inherits all settings from the
    base test case:

    <p align="center">
    <img width="90%" src="images/derivedTestSpec2.png"/>
    </p>

    Inherited sections are marked with a blue icon marker
    <img src="images/derivedIcon.png"/>. Background of
    input fields, which contain data from parent test case is
    set to blue and can not be modified. <p>
    
    Since it does not make much sense to have two
    exactly equal test cases, we can change inheritance status of a section.
    The image blow shows section <i>Analyzer</i>, where
    check-box <i>Inherit</i> is not selected, so modification of
    settings is possible. Inherited status can be toggled by clicking
    the check-box.
    
    <p align="center">
    <img width="90%" src="images/derivedTestSpecNoInherit.png"/>
    </p>
    
    Note, that only complete sections can be inherited. For example,
    it is not possible to inherit only analyzer file name, and
    specify coverage criteria.<p>
    The only field that is never inherited is check-box <b>Execute</b>
    from section <b>Meta</b>.
    

    <h2>Abstract tests</h2>
    <p/>
    Sometimes it may be handy to specify base test case, which should
    not be executed directly, because it only specifies sections for
    derived test cases. Such test cases are called
    <b>abstract</b> test cases. To tell <i>testIDEA</i>, that they
    should <b>not</b> be executed, uncheck the <i>Execute</i> check box
    at the top of section <i>Meta</i>.
