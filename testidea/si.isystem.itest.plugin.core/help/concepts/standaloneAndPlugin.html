    <h1>testIDEA as standalone application and Eclipse plug-in</h1>

    testIDEA was originally designed as Eclipse plug-in, but it was
    deployed as standalone application. Eclipse framework was used
    under the hood, but without any other UI plug-in.<p>

    To make it possible for Eclipse users to use one application for
    development and testing, testIDEA has also been released as 
    Eclipse plug-in. Menus have been adapted to co-exist with other
    plug-ins, and launchers have been implemented to better integrate
    testIDEA with existing Eclipse framework. testIDEA launcher provides
    functionality of running several testIDEA files with single
    action. This functionality is not available in standalone
    testIDEA.<p>

      <b>Recommendation</b><br>

    Eclipse enables users to configure views and editors in many
    different ways. However,
    for most use cases it is recommended to use testIDEA functionality
    in testIDEA perspective (<code>Window | Open Perspective | Other... |
    testIDEA</code>). Although editing and running of iSYSTEM tests is possible also in
    other perspectives, they originally do not show testIDEA's <i>Test Status</i> view,
    which displays warnings and errors during editing, and test results
    after test run. Not all testIDEA menus and tool-bar buttons are
    visible in other perspectives.
      
    <h2>testIDEA as Eclipse plug-in</h2>

    This section describes functionality specific for testIDEA when
    used as Eclipse plug-in.<p>

    <h3>testIDEA perspective</h3>

    To get the familiar testIDEA layout of views, menus, and tool-bar,
    testIDEA perspective should be opened with menu <code>Window |
    Open Perspective | Other... | testIDEA</code>. If we change the
    layout of this perspective, but would like to restore it to the
    original settings, we can select menu command <code>iTools | Reset test
    view</code>.<br>  testIDEA perspective is recommend for test editing and
    running. While some test related actions are available also in other
    perspectives, only this perspective provides all information and
    commands related to iSYSTEM tests.

    <h3>Creating new testIDEA file</h3>

    To create new testIDEA file as part of Eclipse project, open
    testIDEA perspective, and select menu command <code>File | New | Test
    Specification file</code>. A wizard opens, where we can select project
    and enter file name.

    <h3>Project Explorer</h3>

    Eclipse's view called <i>Project Explorer</i> enables management of
    project resources, including testIDEA files.<br>

    testIDEA files can be expanded to show all test cases. If <i>Link
    with Editor</i> button in <i>Project Explorer's</i> tool-bar is pressed,
    test cases selected in <i>Project Explorer</i> is also shown in editor,
    if the file is opened in Eclipse editor.<br>

    It is also possible to start tests with context menu. Right-click
    testIDEA file (<i>*.iyaml</i>), and select <code>Run As</code> or <code>Debug As | testIDEA
    launch</code>. If the file is opened in editor, it should be saved before
    launching, so that results can be unambiguously shown in editor.

    <h3>Export/Import</h3>

    Standard Eclipse commands <code>File | Export</code>, and <code>File |
    Import</code> open a wizard, which provides several export/import
    formats. For testIDEA export/import we should
    select <code>testIDEA | Test Cases</code> and
    click <code>Next</code> button. The standard testIDEA
    export/import dialog opens.<br>  Alternatively, <i>Outline
    view</i> contains <code>Export</code> and <code>Import</code>
    buttons in its tool-bar when testIDEA file is displayed there. These
    buttons open testIDEA export/import dialogs directly.

    <h3>Launch configurations</h3>

    Eclipse launch configurations support execution of groups of
    testIDEA iyaml files. This way we can run tests from several files
    with a single action. These files do not need to be opened in
    Eclipse editors. The first page contains list of files, which
    contain tests to be run:

    <p align="center">
    <img width="90%" src="images/launchConfigurationsTestFiles.png"/>
    </p>

    The first column defines, how to initialize target before running
    tests from the selected file - init sequence can be taken from the
    file, it can be skipped, or init sequence specified in this launch
    configuration (tab <i>Test init</i>) can be used.<p>

    
    The second page contains target init sequence for this launch
    configuration. It is used, when Launch configuration is selected as <i>Test
    Init Source</i> in the table above:

    <p align="center">
    <img width="90%" src="images/launchConfigurationsTestInit.png"/>
    </p>

    When tests are run with launch configurations, they are read from
    file, not editor. It is recommended to save all editors before
    running tests.<br>

    If report configuration in selected files is empty, then blue
    style-sheet is selected as default.<p>

    <hr>
    All other sections in this file apply to standalone and plug-in
    version of testIDEA.<p>&nbsp;
