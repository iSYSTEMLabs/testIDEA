	<h1>testIDEA and Project Configurations</h1>

	<i>testIDEA</i> has two sets of options:
	<ul>
		<li>The first set configures behavior of testIDEA, and has no
			direct influence on test execution. For example, it controls the help
			system and defaults for new projects. This set of options is called <i>Preferences</i>
			and is accessible with command <code>iTools | Preferences</code>.
			These options are stored in <i>testIDEA</i> storage and are the same
			for all projects opened with <i>testIDEA</i>.</li>
		<li>The second set configures test environment. For example, it
			defines target initialization steps before test execution starts.
			This set of options is called <i>Properties</i> and is accessible
			with command <code>File | Properties</code>. These options are stored
			in project file (*.iyaml), and are specific for each project.</li>
	</ul>

	Some pages in Preferences and Properties dialogs are very similar, but
	the following rule always applies for these settings:
	<p>
	<b>Preferences are used only when new project is created - they
		serve as a starting base. Once the project is created, only Properties
		are used.</b>
	<p>

          To make things clearer, the topmost statement on each page
		explains the meaning of settings, as shown in the two figures below:
