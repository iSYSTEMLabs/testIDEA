    <h1>Host variables</h1>

    Host variables are stored on host (PC). They can be treated like
    macros, which are replaced with their values in expressions,
    before they are given to evaluator. They can be used to store
    information between tests, and to provide better configurability
    of tests. They are also used by test creation wizard and can be
    used in exports.

    <h2>Definition</h2>

    Host variables can only be defined in section <i>Variables</i>. They do
    not have type - values are always treated as strings. They can not
    be declared table <i>Declarations of test local variables</i> in
    section <i>Variables</i>, but can have value assigned in
    table <i>Initialization of local and global variables</i>.<p>
    
    Name of
    host variable must always start with <b>${</b> and end
    with <b>}</b>:
    <pre>
        ${&lt;varName&gt;}
    </pre>
    for example:
    <pre>
        ${myVar}
    </pre>

    Example of section <i>Variables</i> with host variables <i>p1,
    p2</i>, and <i>stackPattern</i> defined:

    <p align='center'>
    <img width="90%" src="images/hostVars.png"/>
    </p>

    Assignments to host variables are possible only in Variables section.
    Stub and test-point steps can assign values only to target variables 
    (but may use host variables as R-values).

    Assignments can not be done to <a href="#reserved">reserved</a> host vars.
    

    
    <h2>Where can we use host variables?</h2>
    
    Host variables can be used in places, where values are expected:
    <ul>
    <li>function parameters</li>
    <li>values in section <i>Variables</i></li>
    <li>script function parameters, except scripts in test filters and target init 
     sequence</li>
    <li>pre-condition expressions</li>
    <li>expressions in section <i>Expected</i></li>
    <li>values for assignments in steps of sections <i>Stubs</i> and <i>Test points</i>
    <li>stack usage limits</li>
    <li>HIL values</li>
    <li>Option values</li>
    <li>names of files in analyzer section - document and export file
    names</li>
    <li>log expressions - test case and stubs/test-points logging</li>
    <p>
    
    Host variables can <b>not</b> be used where identifiers and types are
    expected.<br>
    Coverage and profiler statistic values currently do not support 
    host vars.<p>

     <b>Note:</b> Sections <i>Pre-conditions, Options,</i> and
                  scriptf function <i>Init Target</i> are executed <b>before</b>
                  assignments in Variables section. If you want to use
                  host variables in these sections, assign them in
                  test case which executes before this test case!


    <h2>Scope</h2>

     Host variables set in one test case, are available to all derived test cases,
     and test cases with the same parent and on the same hierarchy
     level. For example, host vars defined in test case <i>test-16</i>
     (selected on image below), are visible in all derived tests
     (test-17, test-18, and test-19), and tests having the same parent
     and following <i>test-16</i>: test-20, test-21, test-22, and test-23.

    <img src="images/hostVarsScope.png"/>
    </p>

    
    <h2>Character types</h2>

    Character types are always evaluated as decimal value, unles other
    format specifier is given.


    <h2>Paths as script parameters</h2>
    
    If host variable contains '\' characters, for example file paths on Windows,
    then use Python prefix 'r', when passing host variable as a paramter to 
    script extension function, for example:
    
    <pre>
    r'${_iyamlDir}'
    </pre>

    
    <h2>Strings</h2>

    To assign literal string to host variable we can use quotes:

    <pre>
    ${mode}        "Velocity"
    </pre>

    The value stored in ${mode} is <code>Velocity</code> - string
    without quotes. To use it in assignment to string, we must add quotes, for
    example:

    <p align='center'>
    <img width="90%" src="images/hostVarsStrings.png"/>
    </p>

    Otherwise the value is used as identifier name.
    
    
    <h2>Complex types</h2>

    Host variables always store values as strings, which means that
    their usage is limited in case of complex types like structures
    and arrays. For example, if we have structure:

    <pre>
    struct struct_t {
        char m_c;
        int m_i;
        float m_f;
        double m_d;
        char m_ac[7];
    };
    </pre>

    then value stored in host variable is the same as string printed
    in winIDEA watch window:

    <pre>
    '(\\x00 (0x00),0x00000000,0.0,0.0,"")'
    </pre>

    This string can not be used in expressions, but it can be used for logging.

    <h2 id="reserved">Reserved host variables</h2>
    
    Host variables, which names start with underscore character '_',
    are reserved for internal testIDEA usage.

    <h2>Predefined host variables</h2>

    testIDEA automatically defines the following host variables:<p>

    <b>${_rv}</b> - if function returns non-void type, this host variable
    contains function return value. If it contains primitive
    type (char, int, ...) it can be used in expressions.<p>

    <b>${_env_<environment variable name>}</b> - all environment variables
    are accessible with prefix <i>_env_</i>. These variables can be
    used to pass paths for analyzer files, for example:

    <p align='center'>
    <img width="90%" src="images/hostVarsEnvAndAnalyzer.png"/>
    </p>

    <b>Context specific host variables</b><p>
    There exist also additional context specific host variables, for
    example for diagram output and analyzer file names. They
    are proposed by content proposal and described in descriptions of
    content proposals - select proposal (but do not close proposals
    list) and wait for a second or two until description appears.

    <!-- Output file in section <i>Diagrams</i>:
    <ul>
      <li><code>${_function}</code> - name of function under test</li> 
      <li><code>${_function}</code> - id of current test case</li>
      <li><code>${_diagramType}</code> - type of the diagram to be created</li>
    </ul
     -->
