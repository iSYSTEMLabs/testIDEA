	<h1>testIDEA and Python</h1>

	Scripting and GUI are two ways of interaction with computers.
	Advantages of scripting are flexibility and automation, while GUI
	enables us quick start-up. This section describes how to connect
	<i>testIDEA</i> and Python scripts, to get benefits of both worlds. <p>
	
    <p>
        Scripts can be used for two different tasks. The first task is <b>execution</b>
        of tests and analysis of results, the second task is <b>extending</b>
        test functionality. Both tasks are described below.

    <h2>Executing tests from Python</h2>

    Tests should be run often to detect errors as soon as possible.
    Furthermore, we also want to have more flexibility for configuring test
    environment and the hardware which runs our application. These are
    tasks for scripts. Now the main question arises - how can we reuse test
    specifications created with <i>testIDEA</i> in scripting environment?
    <p />

    The answer is: By loading test specifications from test specification
    file and executing it with the help of
    <i>isystem.test</i> API. <p>Detailed step by step instructions are given in
	section
	<a href="../tasks/generatingScripts.html">Executing tests with Python scripts</a>. 	


	<h2>Extending test functionality</h2>

    If complexity of our test cases exceeds testIDEA capabilities, we can
    extend tests with Python functions, which offer us full flexibility of
    a programming language. For example, if function on target calculates
    Fourier transform of a signal, it is very tedious to type values one by
    one into test specification. By implementing verification with Python
    script, we can verify calculations done on the target by independent
    Python calculation. <p>

    <i>isystem.test</i> contains several points during test execution, where
    custom scripts can be executed. They can be used to:
    <ul>
    <li>filter tests for execution</li>
    <li>initialize target state (test specification tag <code>initTarget</code>)</li>
    <li>initialize global variables and function parameters (test specification tag <code>initFunc</code>)</li>
    <li>verify test results (test specification tag <code>endFunc</code>)</li>
    <li>simulate behavior of stubbed functions (test specification tag <code>script</code> in section <code>stubs</code>)</li>
    <li>restore target state (test specification tag <code>restoreTarget</code>)</li>
    </ul> <p> 
   
    
    Instructions for implementation and usage of script extensions are given in section
    <a href="../tasks/writingScriptFunctions.html">Writing Script Extensions</a>.
