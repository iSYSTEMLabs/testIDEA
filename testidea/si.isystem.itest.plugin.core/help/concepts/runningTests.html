	<h1>Running tests</h1>

	For test execution we have several commands:
	<ul>
		<li>Command <code>Run All</code> executes all tests defined in <i>testIDEA</i>.</li>
		<li>Command <code>Run Selected</code> executes all tests, which

			are selected in test tree. We can select multiple tests to run. Even
			if any of selected tests has derived tests, they are NOT run with
			this option.</li>

		<li>Command <code>Run Selected And Derived</code> executes all
			tests, which are selected in test tree. We can select multiple tests
			to run. If any of selected tests has derived tests, they are also run
			with this option.</li>

		<li>Command <code>Run with Filter</code> executes all tests,
			which satisfy conditions in filter. After executing this command we
			can select a filter to be used for tests specification execution.
			There exist two possibilities for fitering:

			<ul>
				<li><b>built-in filter</b> - this filter is very flexible and
					should satisfy majority of use cases.<br> All fields in tags
					section, which are empty, evaluate to true. This means, that with
					empty filter all tests will be executed. If we want to execute only
					some tests identified by function name and/or test ID, then we have
					to define a nonexisting tag in the <i>Must have all tags</i> field.
					For example, suppose we want to execute tests for functions <code>min()</code>,
					<code>max()</code>, and <code>average()</code>:

					<p align="center">
						<img width="90%" src="images/testFilter.png" />
					</p> Note that we have used a tag, which is not used in any of our test
					specifications (in the example we used <code>'unusedTag'</code>).
					Otherwise all tests would satisfy the tags filter. Now only tests
					specifications for functions mentioned as exceptions will be
					executed, while others will not pass the tags filter.<br> The
					second part defines exceptions to the filtering with tags. All
					exceptions are evaluated in the same order as they are presented in
					the dialog. They override tag conditions. <br></li>

				<li><b>script function</b> - in this case a function in Python
					module is called. It is completely up to our implementation which
					test specifications will be executed. If the function returns <i>true</i>,
					test specification will be executed.</li>
				<p>
			</ul></li>

		<li>Command <code>Run Failed Tests</code> executes all tests,
			which have failed in the previous run.<br> If test suite
			contains a large number of tests, and only few of them fail, it may
			be time consuming to either select failed tests one by one or rerun
			all tests. In such cases we can fix the problem which has caused the
			tests to fail, and then use command <code>Run | Run Failed
			Tests</code>. Only the tests, which have failed on the previous run will be
			executed.<p></li>

		<li>Boolean menu option <code>Keep test results</code> toggles
			erasing of test results on test start. When the option is selected,
			the <code>Run</code> command does not erase results of tests, which
			are not executed. This way we can execute only tests, which have
			failed, and get report for all tests.<p> 
			
			<b>IMPORTANT! Use this functionality with
			caution, because fix for one test may break other tests, which have
			already passed. Do not use this functionality on tests, which are
			interdependent, or which can be influenced by the fix of the problem.
			In such cases always rerun all tests!</b></li>
