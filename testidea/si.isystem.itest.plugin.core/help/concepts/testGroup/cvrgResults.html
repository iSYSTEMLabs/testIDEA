    <h1>Coverage results</h1>
    
    Groups can also contain coverage criteria. It can be
    specified either for tested functions only, or all code in the
    group. For example, if coverage on all code in a group is
    specified, and the group has filter configured for all functions
    in a module, then all code in that module will have to be covered
    to get 100% coverage. Please note, that all code in a group
    is defined by all functions, which are group members, whether 
    test case(s) for them exist or not.
    
    <p/>
    Fields in this section are editable only if coverage is active and
    field <i>Merged analyzer file</i> in section
    <a href="cvrgConfig.html">Coverage config</a> is set.<p/>
    Coverage results contain merged coverage of those test cases in a
    group, which have coverage enabled and saved either in append mode
    or saved to its own trd file.
