    Filter settings define which test cases are members of a group.
    Test cases can be removed or added to group only with filter
    settings. After change in settings, command <span class="menuCmd">Refresh symbols</span> must
    be executed to update test cases in groups.<p/>
    
    Group filter has many settings and it can specify complex criteria
    for test case filtering. However, in most cases only one or two
    items need to be set, like it is done in the image below, where
    all test cases for functions in module <i>listUtils.c</i> are listed.<br>
    Use tool-tips of controls in filter section
    to learn more about their meaning.

    Please note that only executable tests (have <i>Execute</i> flag in
    section <i>Meta</i> selected) can be members of a group.<p/>

    <b>Limitation:</b> Download files with the same name but in different
    directories are not supported.

    
    <h3>Drag and drop</h3>

    <i>Drag & Drop</i> action of a test case on group adds test ID of
    the dropped test cases to filter. This action is convenient for
    defining filter in a new custom group, which has no other items
    set. Only test cases dropped on a group will be group members.<p/>
    
    If filter has already other constraints defined, <i>Drag & drop</i> may
    not add test cases to the group. For example, if filter is
    configured to contain only test cases for functions from module
    <i>signal.c</i>, and test case from module <i>math.c</i> is dropped on the
    group, then this test case will not be part of the
    group. Furthermore, since there is no test case with the given ID
    for functions from module <i>math.c</i>, the group will contain no test
    cases. Modify the filter manually in such cases.
