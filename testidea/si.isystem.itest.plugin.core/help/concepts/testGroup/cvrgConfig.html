    <h1>Coverage configuration</h1>

    We often need to get coverage not only on a function level, but
    also on module or partition level. This can be achieved by
    activating and configuring coverage in the group coverage section.

    Coverage for a group is obtained by merging coverage files of all
    test cases in a group. Of course test cases must also have
    coverage enabled. See
    also <a href="../testSpec/analyzer.html">Analyzer</a> section in
    test case.<p/>
