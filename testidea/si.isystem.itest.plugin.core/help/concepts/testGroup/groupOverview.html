    <h1>Groups of test cases</h1>

    Often we want to get test results not only for individual test
    case, but for wider scope, for example all code in a
    function or module (source file). This information can be obtained
    by creating groups of test cases.<p/>

    <p align='center'>
    <img width="90%" src="images/groupsInOverviewView.png"/>
    </p>

    The code, which belongs to group <b>is defined in a filter section</b>.
    For example, by specifying a module in filter section, all code
    from that module is part of the group. <i>testIDEA</i> then shows all
    unit test cases, which test code (functions) from the selected group as
    members of the group. Test cases can be added to groups only
    changing filter settings.<p/>
    
    Groups are used only as different view of
    existing test cases and to perform statistics on results. They do
    not alter relations between base and derived tests. All test cases
    still exist on their own in <i>testIDEA</i> - they are shown as test
    cases without groups. All test cases in a project are always shown
    below the groups in <i>Outline</i> view, as shown in the image below.

    <p align='center'>
    <img width="90%" src="images/originalTestCases.png"/>
    </p>

    Groups are dynamic containers - when
    group is created, or <i>testIDEA</i> file is opened, groups contain no
    test cases. <i>testIDEA</i> shows which test cases belong to group
    only after symbol refresh.<p/>
        
    <b>Important:</b> If we use Delete action on test case shown in a
    group, the test case will be deleted from a project, not only
    removed from the group.
    <hr>


    <h2>Group hierarchy</h2>

    Groups can have sub-groups as children. Test cases are first
    filtered by parent group, and only those, which pass this filter,
    are used as an input to the sub-group.<br/>
    
    It is common use case to define parent top level group
    with filter for module (source file), and sub-groups with filter
    for modules (source files), and sub-sub groups filter test
    cases on function being tested.
    <p/>

    </p>

    If parent and sub-groups exist, and a test case belongs to both of
    them, then it is shown only in the sub-group. Statistics for
    parent group is calculated from all test cases in the group and
    sub-groups, because they all belong to the parent group.
    
    <h2>Creating groups</h2>

    Before we create groups it is recommended to refresh symbols in
    <i>testIDEA</i> (see command <span class="menuCmd">iTools |
      Refresh</span>). Test cases can be properly assigned to groups
      only with up-to-date symbols. <i>testIDEA</i> automatically
      assigns test cases to groups when symbols are refreshed.
    
    <h3> Menu commands</h3>
    
    There exist two commands in menu <span class="menuCmd">Test</span>
    and in context menu of the <i>Outline view</i>:

    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="menuCmd">New group ...</span> - creates new group in the top level
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="menuCmd">New sub-group</span> - creates new group as sub-group of the
        group currently selected in <i>Outline view</i>.
      </li>
    </ul>

    Filter in the created group is empty, which means that all test cases
    belong to this group. See section <a href="filter.html/#filterConfig">Filter
    configuration</a> below for details.
    
    
    <h3>Wizard</h3>

    Wizard can be used to create hierarchies of groups for several
    download files, modules, and functions at once. It is accessible
    with command <span class="menuCmd">iTools | Create Groups ...</span>

    <p align='center'>
    <img width="50%" src="images/groupsWizard.png"/>
    </p>

    If the wizard is empty, click refresh button in the top right
    corner. When group hierarchy is displayed, select groups which you
    want to be created. Click OK to create groups.<br/>
    Filters are already configured in created groups.
    
    <h2>Running test cases in groups</h2>

    During test case development and group configuration it is
    possible to run only sub-set of all test cases, for example only
    test cases in a group. <br>

    <b>Note:</b> Symbols are not automatically refreshed in such
    case and test cases are not reassigned to groups, because in
    larger projects with many symbols refresh may take few seconds and
    refreshing would be annoying when running one or few test cases.
    When command <span class="menuCmd">Run All</span> is executed,
    then symbols are refreshed and test cases reassigned to groups
    before the run.
    
    <h2 id="groupResults">Group results</h2>

    Group results consist of three sections:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Group statistics - contains statistics of results for test
        cases, functions, modules and partitions.
        <p align='center'>
          <img width="90%" src="images/groupStatistics.png"/>
        </p>&nbsp;<p/>
      </li>
      <li>
        Function statistics - contains more detailed statistics of
        results for functions in a group.
        <p align='center'>
          <img width="90%" src="images/functionStatistics.png"/>
        </p>&nbsp;<p/>
      </li>
      <li>
        Coverage results - contains coverage criteria and measured coverage.
        <p align='center'>
          <img width="90%" src="images/coverageResults.png"/>
        </p>&nbsp;<p/>
      </li>
    </ul>
