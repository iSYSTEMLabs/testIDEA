    <h1>Editing</h1>

    With <i>testIDEA</i> we can set or change all parts of test
    specifications, as described in the <a href="testSpec/testSpec.html">The
    Test Specification</a> page. However, sometimes we also want to
    arrange the order of test specifications, move them between
    instances of <i>testIDEA</i> or between <i>testIDEA</i> and text
    editor. These operations are described on this page.

    <h2>Selecting test specifications</h2>

    If we want to perform the same operation on multiple test
    specifications, we have to select more of them. This can be done
    in one of the following ways:

    <ul>
      <li>
        Hold down the <code>Ctrl</code> key and click test
        specifications in the <code>Test Tree</code> with mouse.
        </li>
      <li>
        Hold down the <code>Ctrl</code> key and move selection with
        cursor keys. Press <code>space</code> to add test
        specification to the selection.
        </li>
      <li>
        Hold down the <code>Shift</code> key and move selection with
        cursor keys. With each move one test specification is added
        to the selection.
        </li>
      </ul>
        
        
    
    <h2>Cut/Copy/Paste</h2>

    Operations from the title move test specification to/from
    operating system's clipboard. They are stored there as plain text
    in YAML format. Therefore we can copy test specification
    from <i>testIDEA</i> to text editor or the other way around.

    <h2>Paste As Derived</h2>

    As the name tells, this command pastes test specification from the
    clipboard as <i>derived</i> test specification of the currently
    selected test specification.
    
    <h2>Paste And Overwrite</h2>

    This command pastes test specification so that all sections, which
    are defined in the test specification on the clipboard, overwrite
    the same sections of the selected test specification. For example,
    if test specification on the clipboard has defined
    sections <code>Coverage</code> and <code>Options</code>, these two
    sections will replace the same sections of the selected test
    specification, regardless if they are defined in the
    selected test specification or not.

    <h2>Copying individual sections</h2>

    Suppose we have section <code>Variables</code>, which we would
    like to apply also to few other test specifications. This can be
    achieved with the following steps:

    <ul>
      <li>
    right click the section <code>Variables</code> in
    the <code>Test Specification Editor</code>, and select
    the <code>Copy</code> command from the context menu.
      </li>
      <li>
    select a test specification in the <code>Test tree</code> view and
    select the <code>Paste And Overwrite</code> command.
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    The section is applied to the selected test specification.

    
    <h2>View test specification source</h2>
    
    The context menu of test specifications in test tree contains
    option <i>Show source</i>.

    <p align="center">
    <img src="images/showSource.png"/>
    </p>

    If we select it, <i>winIDEA</i> opens
    the source files (either <i>iyaml</i> or C/C++ source) and
    positions the cursor to the selected test specification.
    
    <P>
    <b>Note:</b> When we move test specifications around in the test tree,
    source code location may no longer match the one in source
    file. If we save the file, locations are refreshed.
