    <h1>Test case templates</h1>

  If test specifications are similar, we can create new test
  specifications based on one of templates from template
  files. Template files are normal <i>*.iyaml</i> files created
  with <i>testIDEA</i>. To use them as templates, we add them to the
  list of files in the <code>Templates</code> dialog. The same dialog
  is also used for adding new test specifications based on templates
  to the current project in <i>testIDEA</i>. Select option <code>File
  | New Test From Template...</code>, and the following dialog opens:

   <p align="center">
     <img src="images/templatesDialog.png"/>
   </p>

  This dialog can be used to edit list of template files - we can have
  more of them, if needed. Test specifications from the selected file
  are shown in the bottom pane. To add a new test specifiation to the
  current project, select the test specification in the dialog and
  click OK. If you want it to be added as a derived test specification of the
  currently selected test specification in <i>testIDEA</i>, check also
  the <code>Add as derived test</code> check box.
