    <h1>Comments in test cases</h1>

    The YAML test specification allows comments in test specifications, but
    they are intended for human readers only, and are ignored by
    parsers. To preserve comments in test specifications,
    <i>testIDEA</i> has a modified parser, which saves comments.
    
    However, to be able to save comments back to YAML file to proper
    locations, comments are attached to items in test
    specifications. This also means, that there are additional rules
    for writing comments, which extend the official YAML syntax. These
    rules are not complex, but they are important when editing test
    specifications in text editor. <i>testIDEA</i> takes care about
    proper formatting automatically. If you are not editing test cases
    in text editor, you can skip the next four sections (<i>End of line
    comments</i>, ...) and continue
    reading <a href="#commentInTI">Comments in testIDEA</a> below.
      


    <h2>End of line comments</h2>

    <i>End of line comments</i> are written after YAML tokens on the same line.
    These comments are attached to the last scalar on the same
    line.<p>
    Example:

    <pre>
        locals:     # comment for section 'locals'
          x: int    # comment for type 'int'
          y: MyType # comment for type 'MyType'
    </pre>

        
    <h2>New line comments</h2>

    <i>New line comments</i> are written before the token. There are no YAML token in
    this line. These comments are attached to the first token on the
    next line.<p>
    Example:

    <pre>
        # comment for section 'locals'
        locals:     
          # comment for var x
          x: int    
          # comment for var y
          y: MyType 
    </pre>


    <h2>Mixed comments</h2>

    For mixed comment the same rules apply for end of line and new
    line comments. <p>

    Example:

    <pre>
        # comment for section 'locals'
        locals:     # comment for section 'locals'
          # comment for var x
          x: int    # comment for type 'int'
          # comment for var y
          y: MyType # comment for type 'MyType'
    </pre>


    <h2>Ignored comments</h2>
    
    Comments in flow sequences are ignored. Use block format when
    you want to comment items. <p>

    Examples:
    <p>

    Comments will be preserved in this case
    <pre>
        tags:
        - tagA,  # eol comment A
        - tagB,  # eol comment B
        - tagC   # eol comment C
    </pre>

    Flow style on the other hand, ignores comments and formatting:

    <pre>
    tags: [tagA,  # ignored comment A
           tagB,  # ignored comment B
           tagC   # ignored comment C
          ] # ignored comment C
    </pre>

    When saved, the following is written to file:
    <pre>
    tags: [tagA, tagB, tagC]
    </pre>


    Comments in the last line of test specification have no scalar
    to be attached to, so they are ignored and therefore not written to
    output when the test specification is saved.

    
    <h2><a name="commentInTI">Comments in testIDEA</a></h2>

    <i>testIDEA</i> supports viewing and editing of comments in test
    specifications.  Comments are shown in UI as tooltips of input
    field decorations, and can also be edited by clicking these
    decorations.<p>

    When we move mouse cursor to decoration icon, the comment is
    displayed in tooltip as shown in the image.
       <p align="center">
         <img width="90%" src="images/commentAsTooltip.png"/>
       </p>
      </li>

    If there is no comment, nothing happens.<p>
    The comment edit dialog opens, when we click active decoration icon:

       <p align="center">
         <img src="images/commentEditDialog.png"/>
       </p>

    
    To visually present status of comment for each test specification
    item, decoration icons can have one of four states, as shown in
    the image below:

       <p align="center">
         <img width="90%" src="images/comments.png"/>
       </p>

    Description of comment states:
       
    <ul>
      <li><i>non-editable empty comment</i> - fields, which are empty
        are not written to test specification, so there can be no
        comment attached to them. Until we enter some value into the
        input field, comments are disabled.</li>
        
      <li><i>existing editable comment</i> - comment is already
      specified, we can see it as decoration tooltip and edit it by
      clicking the decoration icon.
        
      <li><i>existing non-editable comment</i> - comment is 
      specified, we can see it as decoration tooltip but we can not
      edit it, because it is specified in base test specification.
        To edit it, we have to select the base test specification,
      where it is defined.
      </li>
        
      <li><i>empty, but editable comment</i> - comment is not
        specified, but we can edit it by clicking the decoration
        icon.

      </li>
      </ul>

    <p>If an item with comment is deleted from test specification, then
		the comment is also deleted. It is not possible to preserve comments
		without data. For example, if we specify test ID and its comment, and
		then decide to delete the id, the comment is also deleted.

    <p>Most edit fields contain data for simple YAML tags. These
    fields have only one decoration icon on the right. Fields, which
    refer to structured items, for example the 'Function' field, have
    additional decoration icon on the left. If we are editing test
    specifications in <i>testIDEA</i> only, then it does not matter,
    which decoration we use. If location of the comment in YAML test
    specification is important, we can enter the comment, then copy the test
    case to the clipboard and paste it a text editor. There we can see the
    exact location of the comment.
      
      
		
    <h2>Comments in tables</h2>

	To set a comment for item in a table, first select the line in the table,
	then click the decoration icon on the left side of the table. If a
	table item has a comment assigned, it is marked with blue dot. To see a
	comment, select a line and move cursor above the comment decoration
	icon on the left side, as shown in the image below.
	
	   <p align = "center">
         <img width="90%" src="images/commentsInTables.png"/>
       </p>

    Decoration icons on the left side refer to the <i>locals:</i>
    section in a test case. The top icon contains comment for
    the <i>locals</i> tag itself. The bottom icon contains comment for
    the selected variable declaration.<p>
           
    Decoration icons on the right side refer to the <i>init:</i>
    section in a test case. The top icon contains comment for
    the <i>init</i> tag itself. The bottom icon contains comment for
    the selected variable initialization.<p>
           
<p>
	<h2>Limitations of <i>testIDEA</i></h2>
    
    When tags or function parameters are edited in <i>testIDEA</i>,
    comments are not preserved for list items. This means that in
    these two cases it is possible to write comments in 
    text editor, but they are not visible or
    editable in <i>testIDEA</i>. If you modify these two fields in
    <i>testIDEA</i>, comments for list items are lost. <p>Example:<p>

    The following was written in text editor:
    <pre>
    tags:      # part of regression tests
    - moduleA  # communication functions
    - moduleB  # math functions
    func:
    - f     # test for midnight
    - - 24  # hours
      - 00  # minutes
    </pre>

    This was later modified in testIDEA. The following was saved:
    <pre>
    tags:      # part of regression tests
    - moduleA  
    - moduleB  
    func:
    - f     # test for midnight
    - - 24  
      - 00  
    </pre>

    Note, that other comments than ones for tag items and parameters
    were preserved.

    <p>
    All other items in test specification preserve comments.
