    <h1>Connection to winIDEA</h1>

    When defining test specification, function and variable names
    must be specified. <i>winIDEA</i> knows names of all functions and
    variables from debug info, and <i>testIDEA</i> can get this information
    from <i>winIDEA</i> to help us with auto-completion. Therefore it is
    convenient to have <i>winIDEA</i> running, when specifying
    tests. <p/>

    <p/>
    Once <i>winIDEA</i> is running, <i>testIDEA</i>
    can connect to it. For convenience there are several ways to connect:

    <ul>
    <li>
    The simplest one is the main menu option <code>iTools | Connect to winIDEA</code>
    in <i>iSYSTEM testIDEA</i>.
    </li>
    <li>
    The next possibility is simply pressing the <i>Refresh</i> button, and
    testIDEA asks us, whether we want to connect.
    </li>
    <li>
    It is also possible to configure <i>testIDEA</i> to connect
    automatically, with <code>iTools | Preferences | testIDEA | Connect automatically</code>.
    </li>
    </ul>
    
    Connection status is shown in the bottom left corner of the <i>iSYSTEM testIDEA</i> window:

    <p align="center">
    <img src="images/connectionStatus.png"/>
    </p>

    
    <b>Note 1:</b> <i>winIDEA</i> must download the code for symbols to be
    available. If we don't have target available, switching
    <i>winIDEA</i> to demo mode will also do the trick (main menu option
    <code>Hardware | Demo mode</code> in <i>winIDEA</i>).
    <p/>

    <b>Note 2:</b> If <i>testIDEA</i> was started from winIDEA (menu
    <code>Test | Launch testIDEA</code>), then it can connect only to this instance
    of <i>winIDEA</i>. If we close the <i>winIDEA</i>
    instance, <i>testIDEA</i> can not connect anywhere, and we must
    close it also. This behavior may seem inconvenient, but if we have
    several instances of <i>winIDEA</i> and <i>testIDEA</i> running, this tight
    coupling provides a controllable development environment. <br>
    To get a <i>testIDEA</i> instance, which can connect to
    any <i>winIDEA</i>, run it
    directly from Windows, not from <i>winIDEA</i>.
