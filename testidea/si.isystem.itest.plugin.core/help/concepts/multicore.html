    <h1>Multi-core testing</h1>

    With multi-core targets a need to run tests on a specific core
appears. To be able to utilize multi-core testing, we must first
properly configure testIDEA.

    
    <h2>Configure core IDs</h2>

    Each core is identified by its index. To make this identification
    more user friendly, we can assign name to each core in project
    properties (<code>File | Properties | Multicore
    configuration</code>). Comma separated list contains list of core
    IDs, where the first item refers to core with index 0 or primary
    core, the next item refers to core with index 1, ... <br>

    Button <i>Get from winIDEA</i> reads core IDs from winIDEA. Names
    will be the same as found in winIDEA
    menu <span class="menuCmd">Debug | Core</span>. It is a
    convenience feature, but not mandatory - names of cores in
    testIDEA may differ from those in winIDEA, so that we can use the
    same iyaml file when our code is compiled and tested on different
    targets.

    </p>

    If this field is empty, we can not specify test IDs in test cases.
    
    <h2>Initialization sequence</h2>

    With more than one core the initialization sequence becomes more
    complex. For each core we must make sure that:
    <ul>
      <li>testIDEA connects to core</li>
      <li>the code is downloaded and winIDEA knows application symbols</li>
      <li>core is active (released from reset)</li>
      <li>startup code for the core is executed (for example <i>run until
      main()</i>), so that stack is initialized</li>
    </ul>

    See also the screenshot below.

    <p/>
    
    The recommended approach for init sequence configuration is manual
    initialization of <i>winIDEAs</i> for all cores we want to test. During
    this operation we write down all actions, for example: <i>Download,
    Run until main(), Debug | Core, ... </i> When done, we enter this
    sequence into <i>Run configuration</i> dialog (<code>Run | Run
      configuration</code>). Example for target with two cores is shown in
    the image below. Empty field for core ID refers to primary core
    (core with index 0).

    </p>

    Available actions and their parameters are described in table
    tool-tip (hover the question mark icon in the top left corner of
    the <code>Init sequence</code> table).
    
    
    
    <h2>Assign core IDs to test cases</h2>

    The final step is defining core ID for each test case. Since list
    of functions given by content assist depends on core selection, it
    is a good idea to select core ID first. If core ID field is left
    empty, primary core is assumed.
